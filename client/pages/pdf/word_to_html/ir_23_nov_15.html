  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter1-article1"></a><h2>More VCs will switch to a market-focused strategy in 2016 says exec</h2>
  <p class="text-info">In 2016, the funding of early stage companies will see an evolution from traditional series and stage focused VCs toward market-focused VCs according to Cloud Apps Capital Partners founder Matt Holleran.</p>
  <p>Cloud Apps Capital Partners is a market-focused early stage venture capital fund, and Holleran told AltAssets that he predicts more firms will emerge with a similar market focus. He said, “The hole in the market that is growing every day is that the larger venture firms, which have a $1bn or more in assets, typically look to write $8m to $15m cheques for their first investment (Series A round).</p>
  <p>“At these investments, they are requiring a proof of market traction, as well as a formed executive team, and visibility into the operating model and the go-to-market/customer acquisition math economics. If you’re an entrepreneur you want to build a team, build a product, start to show the traction that later stage VC firms need, and this is the big hole the market-focused firms are stepping into.”</p>
  <p>In order to get to this level of market traction and solid operational cadence, early stage companies need $3m or $5m according to Holleran, something the angel market or the seed syndicates cannot adequately support. “The syndicates and the angel seed market can’t provide enough capital, or enough domain expertise, or institutional, venture or board management that the larger companies want to see. </p>
  <p>“Cloud Apps Capital Partners is trying to address this hole in our market, which is cloud business applications, and we think this a trend you will see from other venture firms operating in the technology space.” However, in order to do this firms need deep domain expertise in a particular market within the technology world, he added. </p>
  <p>“In order to make these investments pre visible transactions, you need to have context in the markets, knowledge of the business model, and you need to have highly relative networks in which to make executive appointments to grow the team. There are other firms in other specific markets with a similar view, we think this is what entrepreneurs need, we think this is what the follow on large investors want to see and as result we are helping those entrepreneurs build great businesses. We are complimenting the likes of Sequoia and Greylock, as well as complementary to the leading high value angels; but in a different, more impactful way than headless syndicates.” </p>

  <p class="text-info">The value of private equity, venture capital and development capital investment in cleantech companies soared to more than $2.3bn in October after four months of consecutive decline, new research shows.</p>
  <p>The rise from $332m in September marked the third-highest result of 2015 so far, trailing only February’s $5.3bn and May’s $2.35bn, data from Zephyr published by BvD revealed. It said volume also improved for the third successive month to 32 deals, albeit at the slower rate of seven per cent. Zephyr said that an increase was also noticeable year-on-year, as October 2014 had investment of $1.25bn across 29 transactions.</p>
  <p>It added that a large portion of value in October could be attributed to a single transaction, as the top deal was worth over $1.1bn. That was the institutional buyout of Renovalia Energy, a Spain-based renewable energy producer, by Renaleto Servicios y Gestion, a subsidiary of Cerberus Capital Management. That deal alone accounted for about half of the 2.3bn invested in October.</p>
  <p>This deal was almost four times the size of October’s second-largest transaction, which involved Sunnova Energy raising $300m from investors including Triangle Peak Partners, Franklin Square Capital and GSO Capital Partners. Closely following this was ReNew Power Ventures, which secured a fourth round funding worth $265m from Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and existing investors such as Goldman Sachs and GEF Management Corporate.</p>
  <p>Of the top 20 transactions nine targeted US companies, while countries including Spain, China, France and India were also targeted more than once. In terms of volume cleantech companies in the US led the way in the month under review as there were 14 deals targeting the country in October, up from six in September and eight in October 2014. Zephyr said that represented the largest number of deals in the country since July 2014, when 15 deals were recorded. India ranked second with three transactions, while France, China, Spain and Belgium each had two deals.</p>
  <p> “[Nigeria’s government] has done a lot to sell off and privatise various old assets and start some new projects in the last five years but it is just not getting built. But Nigeria is one of the most interesting African markets and it is no wonder that there is a huge amount of private capital looking at Nigerian opportunities. But very few of them have made much money and quite a lot of people have lost a lot because things just do not happen. Nigeria is one of the great targets but has not delivered on its potential.”</p>
  <p>Sub-Saharan Africa will be the region to see the greatest growth rate for utilities spending over the next ten years, according to the PwC report. Overall, Nigeria and South Africa dominate the capital project and infrastructure market in the region, the report says. Nigeria’s share is expected to grow substantially over the next decade because of better government finances and the fastest rate of urbanisation on the continent. In general, infrastructure spending in Sub-Saharan Africa will grow on average 10 per cent a year in the next ten years, exceeding $180bn by 2025, PwC projects. </p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter2-article1"></a><h2>Canadian pension trio agree $2.8bn deal for Chicago Skyway toll road</h2>
  <p class="text-info">Three Canadian pension funds have agreed a $2.8bn deal to acquire the operator of the Chicago Skyway toll road.</p>
  <p>Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB), Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System (OMERS) and Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan (OTPP) will each contribute $512m for a one-third stake in Skyway Concession. The 12.5-kilometre toll road that spans the Chicago Skyway Bridge was built in 1958.</p>
  <p>It was run by the City of Chicago for several decades before a 99-year operating lease was sold to Skyway Concession in 2005. Skyway’s acquisition was backed by Spanish transportation infrastructure group Cintra SA and divisions of Macquarie Group. Senior vice-president of infrastructure at the OTPP, Andrew Claerhout said, “Skyway is a critical asset for the Chicago region that will provide inflation-protected returns to match our liabilities and further diversify our infrastructure portfolio.”</p>
  <p>Ralph Berg, global head of infrastructure at OMERS, added, “Our investment in Skyway also fits with our goal of growing our assets under management in the North American infrastructure space.  “The fund has set a target to boost infrastructure investments from 14.7 per cent of the portfolio as of its 2014 year to 21.5 per cent within a few years.” </p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter2-article2"></a><h2>State of Michigan spreads $751m across seven PE funds</h2>
  <p class="text-info">The State of Michigan Retirement Systems has invested over $750m across seven private equity funds in the last quarter, AltAssets can reveal.</p>
  <p>Between the 1st of April and the 30th of June this year, the $61.7bn pension plan made a number of commitments to private equity and real estate funds according to a September report from the pension plan’s investment advisory committee. Its biggest commitment was the $300m investment in Blackstone Capital Partners VII. Last month, AltAssets reported that Blackstone’s seventh global private equity fund was set to hit a final close on $17.5bn by the end of year.</p>
  <p>According to the September report, the State of Michigan Retirement Systems also provided a $150m commitment to Coller International Partners VII and $111m to Carlyle Europe Partners IV, respectively. It is an existing investor in Coller Capital’s funds, having previously backed Coller International Partners IV, Coller International Partners V and Coller International Partners VI.</p>
  <p>In July, Secondaries private equity major Coller Capital reportedly held a $3.1bn first close for its seventh flagship fund, with the Pennsylvania Public School Employees’ Retirement System making a $100m commitment to the fund and the Louisiana State Employees’ Retirement System providing $75m. In May, AltAssets revealed that Carlyle’s fourth Euro fund had reeled in €2.6bn from 143 LPs, although it is unclear how much the vehicle is targeting.</p>
  <p>The State of Michigan Retirement Systems has also provided $75m to Centerbridge Capital Partners III, a $45m cheque to Encap Energy Capital Fund X, Peninsula Fund V with a $40m commitment and $30m to Arboretum Ventures IV. In the year ended 30 June, the State of Michigan Retirement Systems’ private equity division returned more than 12 per cent, or $1.4bn net of contributions, according to the document.</p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter2-article3"></a><h2>APG, CPPIB form $500m Korean logistics development platform</h2>
  <p class="text-info">Dutch Pension fund manager APG Asset Management and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board have established $500m Korean logistics development platform.</p>
  <p>The pair have established a joint venture platform with logistics developer, owner, and operator e-Shang and its Seoul-based subsidiary Kendall Square Logistics Properties (“KSLP”). According to a statement by the firms, The JV will develop and own a portfolio of institutional-grade, modern logistics real estate assets across South Korea. It will initially be supported with equity commitments totalling $500m, with an option to $1bn. </p>
  <p>“This investment is a great opportunity for CPPIB to enter the growing and highly sought-after logistics sector in South Korea,” said Jimmy Phua, CPPIB managing director and head of real estate investments Asia. “Developing logistics facilities in a market like Korea – which is supported by increased trading volume and greater domestic consumption – is an attractive use of capital for a long-term investor like CPPIB. In addition, we look forward to expanding our relationship with APG through this joint venture and to working with e-Shang and KSLP.” </p>
  <p>e-Shang was founded in 2011 by global private equity firm Warburg Pincus and two Chinese entrepreneurs. Last year, domestic logistics developer received a substantial investment from APG and expanded its business outside of China by partnering with logistics real estate veterans Thomas Nam and Jihun Kang to form KSLP. The JV plans to invest in a pipeline of development opportunities in the Seoul and Busan Metropolitan Areas and have already secured two assets in the Seoul region that will be used to seed the JV. It will target to own a portfolio of logistics real estate assets with an aggregate size of over 1.5 million square metres in gross floor area over the next several years.</p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter2-article4"></a><h2>CalPERS CIO says private equity is best performer</h2>
  <p class="text-info">Private equity is CalPERS’ best performing long-term asset class according to chief investment officer Theodore Eliopoulos.</p>
  <p>Speaking at an educational workshop on advantages of private equity, Eliopoulos said there was no substitution for the asset class according to Pensions & Investments. The asset returned 8.9 per cent in fiscal year 2015 and has consistently outperformed the fund’s overall expected return rate of 7.5 per cent. Eliopoulos noted that for the five years ended June 30, its private equity portfolio returned an annualized 14.4 per cent, compared with public equities’ 12.9 per cent.</p>
  <p>Managing investment director-private equity, Real Desrochers, said that the supply of institutional funds is significantly less than the demand from limited partners. Earlier this year, California’s state treasurer, John Chiang, reportedly called for state legislation to enforce private equity firms to disclose all fees charged to the state’s largest public pension funds. </p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter2-article5"></a><h2>Ohio Police, Fire pension commits to new Advent megafund</h2>
  <p class="text-info">The $13.9bn-managing Ohio Police and Fire Pension Fund has agreed to commit up to $50m to the latest flagship buyout fund being raised by Advent International.</p>
  <p>Advent is currently looking to raise up to $12bn for Fund VIII, which would easily make the vehicle its largest to date. The firm closed its last flagship fund on €8.5bn in 2012, easily surpassing the €6.6bn fund it raised in 2008. OP&F said the commitment took its total private markets commitments in 2015 to $283m, about $42m shy of the target for the year, which runs through January 2016.</p>
  <p>As of the end of October OP&F’s private markets portfolio was valued at $790m, or 5.6 per cent of the total portfolio. Its long-term target is eight per cent. Advent VIII will focus on control buyouts primarily in North America and Europe, targeting companies within the business and financial services, technology, media, and telecommunications, industrial, retail consumer and leisure and health care sectors. OP&F also invested in Advent VII, which was approved in 2012.</p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter2-article6"></a><h2>LP Profile: Jim Strang, Hamilton Lane</h2>
  <p class="text-info">Private equity investment manager Hamilton Lane is a bit different. For a start it’s a company, not a partnership. Newly-promoted London head Jim Strang has ambitions to grow the business, but won’t change its mantra of being “careful and cautious”.</p>
  <p>Jim Strang is at ease being interviewed. He talks freely and eloquently about the nitty gritty of private equity and is not short of words. But when asked what he would change about private equity, there’s a rare pause. “It’s around the way we talk about what we do,” he says, gathering momentum. “It’s still very opaque and that creates misconceptions and misconceptions that could be addressed, should be addressed, and would help people understand what we do. I’ve been in public markets and this is way better. But it’s just not understood and people get the wrong end of the stick. </p>
  <p>“Because it’s private, people think there is something going on that is not quite right. We should be more open about what we do.” Strang has recently been promoted to head of the London office at Hamilton Lane, a global private equity investment manager, which he joined in 2011. With more than $233bn of assets under management and supervision, Hamilton Lane employees 235 people in the US, Europe, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East. Next year it will celebrate 25 years of operations.</p>
  <p>A little different</p>
  <p>Strang is responsible for 17 of those people, running operations from Hamilton Lane’s London office in the heart of Westminster, just off Parliament Square. It’s not a regular address for a private equity outfit – who cluster on the other side of St James’s Park in Mayfair – but Strang says it is “good value” and there is room for another 10 people. Expansion is clearly on the agenda. Hamilton Lane started life in Philadelphia as an adviser to a couple of big US pension schemes who, as part of their own fiduciary structure were required to have an adviser. </p>
  <p>In the mid to late 1990s the company branched out into investment management, and since then has run the two operations in parallel. “The difference is down to where the ultimate decision authority lies,” explains Strang. “On the advisory mandates the client makes the decision, and with investment mandates, we do. We can advise on any element of their business and we set it up deliberately to be very flexible. What goes into the advisory bucket is a massive, amorphous mass of different arrangements.” </p>
  <p>Today, about $200bn of assets are under advisory and $34bn in investment management. Strang says the massive advisory business gives the firm a real competitive edge. 
“It gives us amazing access to data,” he says. “In a world that is inherently subjective we’ve got a pretty unique perspective because we have data from this massive chunk of information. When we look to benchmark, we typically don’t use anyone else’s benchmarks because we have enough data to create our own, because we have this massive advisory business. It also allows us to pull more weight in the market because of the scale of things we are negotiating on behalf of our clients.”
</p>
  <p>Hamilton Lane’s headquarters are in Philadelphia, where the majority of the staff are based, and the firm has offices in San Francisco, San Diego, Las Vegas, New York, Fort Lauderdale, London, Tel Aviv, Rio de Janeiro, Hong Kong and Tokyo.
“It’s getting to be a big old world out there,” says Strang. “When we started out 25 years ago you had the US, Europe and a little bit in the Far East and that was it. Now you can do everything from infrastructure in Indonesia to mining in Canada, to drug royalties in Switzerland, music rights in Nashville, you name it. 
</p>
  <p>“Then you have venture capital, credit, private equity, real assets, infrastructure, property and many more. Private equity is a misnomer because there is a lot more to it. We’re singularly focused on private markets investing, and that encompasses everything from venture to credit, infrastructure to real estate,” he continues. “We review opportunities across the sectors every year. We ask what is changing? How do we feel the relative value and the relative attractiveness of different parts of the asset class are shifting? What can we do about it?”</p>
  <p>A good example of the shifting sands in alternative assets is credit. “A few years ago, in the midst of the global financial crisis, we definitely increased our credit exposure and dialled back somewhat in traditional private equity,” says Strang. “But the credit cycle has normalised, and as returns have compressed we have moderated that position somewhat. One of the challenges with credit investing is that the windows where returns are exceptional tend to be quite short, and it’s hard to predict when they’ll occur. With the credit crisis there was a definite opportunity to make out like a bandit with all the stress, because you need stress to be able to buy well. Now the returns are being compressed by the fact that there is less stress, and that has taken away part of the upside.”</p>
  <p>Historically, private equity has done well coming out of recessions. Strang says that it comes down to GPs being able to handle complexity. “The challenge with buying through a crisis is that you need to have the conviction that you’re not buying something that’s going to keep falling. You need to have the conviction to say, ‘Despite the starting point and the difficult environment, we’re starting from here and we are going to go to there. And we know we’re going to get to there because we’ve done it before, several times before, and we have the capability to do it.’”</p>
  <p>Strang says Hamilton Lane has fared well during the crisis, as has the wider private equity industry, particularly in the US. “We thought the way the crisis was playing out it was going to be better to be in the US, because the way Bernanke and the Fed implemented QE was a bit different to what happened here in Europe. In Europe we were cautious and careful about who we backed. That doesn’t mean we went exclusively with brand names, but the classic example is to try and find someone that brings a lot of capability to the challenge at hand – ‘a gun to a knife fight,’ so to speak. You can get that up and down the spectrum, but with smaller funds you have to be a bit more selective – there are not so many that have that sort of capability.”</p>
  <p>There is a danger in private equity, particularly funds of funds, of over diversification. Hamilton Lane aims for around 25 GP names in a typical fund of funds “We try to make as few investments as possible,” says Strang. “We think that a lot of portfolios end up hugely over-diversified because some people think about picking funds like they pick stocks, when it is actually like picking a mutual fund in terms of the underlying assets. “You need to have a bit more conviction about who you are backing. When we have an investment conversation we ask two questions: what do we think of this, and if we did it, would it add something to the portfolio that we are not currently getting? If not we have to ask why we are doing it, because it is just another level of complexity.”</p>
  <p>Hamilton Lane’s investments out of Europe range from less than $5m to “hundreds of millions”, depending on the situation. “We did a $2m investment in a German consumer internet fund, because it went into one specific portfolio which needed a specific type of exposure. At the other end of the spectrum, we invested hundreds of millions in a large buyout fund, where client-wise we lined up all the guns on the battleship and fired them at the same time.
”The environment for new private equity investments is a challenging one at the moment. Prices are high in all segments of the industry. 
</p>
  <P>“We’re at the top in terms of pricing metrics and there is still a lot of uncertainty out there,” says Strang. “That seems to go from top down to bottom through the industry. But I guess that if you think that we are nearing the top of a cycle – and let’s assume for the sake of argument that we are – then if you are going to come down the other side in stormy seas you want to be in a bigger boat. Bigger businesses that are more defined globally may prove to be safer bets. If you are looking at small companies in local markets with more specific risks, when you are still paying relatively full prices, then that feels like a riskier trade to me. </P>
  <p>“It’s good to exercise caution on the really small unless they are in the hands of people you think are experts in the game. Then as you head up the scale to the very large, they may struggle because of that scale. Mid-market private equity still seems to be a reasonable bet.”</p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter3-article1"></a><h2>Blackstone expects quick LP uptake for imminent €7bn Euro real estate fundraise</h2>
  <p class="text-info">Listed US private equity giant Blackstone is ready to launch a new European real estate vehicle targeting up to €7bn.</p>
  <p>The firm hopes to launch Blackstone Real Estate Partners Europe V in the first quarter of 2016 according to documents released by the San Francisco Employees’ Retirement System. SFERS’ board meeting today will discuss a potential €100m commitment to BREP V, the documents show. Blackstone held a €5.1bn final close for its fourth Europe-focused real estate fund in March 2014, taking just six months between the first and final closes. </p>
  <p>And the firm has wasted no time returning to the market for Fund V, which will have a net return target of 15 per cent and net multiple of 1.7-times. It also shows the fund has a carried interest of 20 per cent and a preferred return of eight per cent. The fund intends to invest at least 60 per cent in the UK, Germany and France. Details released to SFERS showed Blackstone was expecting strong demand for the fund thanks to the results of its oversubscribed Fund IV, which already had a net IRR at the end of September this year. </p>
  <p>Like its predecessor, Fund IV has been focused primarily on picking up distressed real estate assets in the UK and continental Europe. If it reaches its target Fund V will be more than double the firm’s third RE fund, which closed in 2009. Blackstone Real Estate Partners Europe III beat its intended target of €2.5bn by landing €3.1bn in commitments. Investment targets have included hotels, healthcare-related real estate assets and student housing.</p>
  <p>In May last year, the fund held a $450m first close, with $200m coming from ICG, according to the firm’s preliminary results for the 2014 fiscal year. Part of the fund is raised by a parallel vehicle, ICG North American Private Debt Fund (offshore) according to a separate filing. Last month, New York-based Neuberger Berman closed its private debt fund on $620m, having already invested 52 per cent of the capital. </p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter3-article2"></a><h2>Audax closes Fund V on $2.25bn hard cap</h2>
  <p class="text-info">US-based alternative asset management firm Audax Group has closed its oversubscribed fifth private equity fund on its $2.25bn hard cap. </p>
  <p>Audax Private Equity Fund V surpassed its initial $1.75bn target, with committed capital coming from a select group of institutional and high-net worth LPs. It raised capital from public and corporate pension funds, insurance companies, endowments and foundations and high net worth families. In addition, it also received a significant commitment from the firm’s senior professionals.</p>
  <p>Co-CEOs, Geoffrey Rehnert and Marc Wolpow, said in a joint statement, “We appreciate the support from our existing and new investors and thank them for their commitment to Audax. The significant demand for our fifth private equity fund underscores the capability of our team and our differentiated strategy, as well as our investors’ confidence in our consistent track record of delivering attractive returns.”</p>
  <p>Fund V comes nearly four years after the closing of its predecessor, which reached its hard cap of $1.2bn, 25 percent ahead of the $1bn target. Consistent with its predecessor private equity funds, Audax said Fund V will continue its proven strategy of investing in middle-market companies across a select group of industries. </p>
  <p>The fund will primarily invest in companies valued at between $50 million to $300 million, including debt. Founded in 1999 with offices in Boston, New York and Menlo Park, California, Audax has raised $12 billion of capital and currently manages more than $9 billion through its private equity and private debt businesses.</p>

  <p>The firm is yet to register any capital for Scale Venture Partner V according to a new filing with the US Securities & Exchange Commission. Scale indicates in the filing that it expects to complete the fundraise within the next 12 months. 
The new raise comes two years after Scale closed its fourth venture capital fund on $300m.
</p>
  <p>The firm has been focused on investing in early-in-revenue technology companies in the cloud, mobile, SaaS and internet sectors. Scale’s fourth fundraise meant it had secured total commitments of $1.5bn. It closed its third fund on $250m in early 2010. Previous investments include Box, DocuSign, HubSpot, ExactTarget, RingCentral and Omniture.</p>

  <p class="text-info">US private equity firm Tritium Partners has held a final closing for its oversubscribed debut fund on its $309m hard cap.</p>
  <p>The fund, dubbed Tritium I, received commitments from leading retirement systems, private pension plans, university endowments, foundations, diversified financial institutions and insurance companies. In December 2014, AltAssets reported that the fund had passed the $71m mark and had received commitments from 40 LPs towards its $250m target. </p>
  <p>Tritium specialises in buyouts of lower middle market growth companies in industries where the team has significant domain expertise. In the past, it has primarily backed companies in Internet and information services, supply chain and logistics, and financial and business services sectors. Managing partner and co-founder David Lack said, “Our track record and partnership-oriented approach to building growth companies resonates with proven business leaders and talented founders. </p>
  <p>“Our focus on a handful of investment sectors provides the experience and strategic insights which we use to help our teams accelerate organic growth and enhance value through complementary acquisitions. This has proven to be a winning formula for all stakeholders.”
According to the firm, the vehicle has already added four companies to its portfolio. The firm has backed financial & business services company Giact, logistics businesses RoadOne and Global Access, and Fexy Media according to its website.

  <p class="text-info">US venture capital major Andreessen Horowitz has raised $200m for a new fund targeting biocomputing led by former Stanford University professor Vijay Pande.</p>
  <p>Pande began working with AH last year when he joined as the firm’s first ‘professor in residence’ from Stanford, where he was professor of chemistry, computer science and structural biology. The firm hopes to leverage those talents with the new fund, which will look to make advances by combining technologies in life sciences and computing. Pande said in a blog post on AH’s website, “We all care about human health — whether it’s for ourselves, our parents, our children — and it’s a big deal on a very deep, fundamental level, in terms of thinking about the meaning of life. At a much more mundane business level, there’s clearly a huge market opportunity here. Just think of the marketing budget that Google can go after [with ads and such] – $200bn. But compared to that, the US healthcare budget is $2tn. </p>
  <p>“Even tiny little sub-budgets of that are huge markets for startups to go after. Bio is therefore an area where there’s a real chance to change the world… but also a chance for really great financial returns as well. The firm has been excited about this space for a while, and we’ve made investments before even raising a bio fund. But we want to do something really big, and expect this to grow bigger in time, so establishing a separate fund is also about our thinking years down the road.”</p>
  <p>AH has previously invested in businesses merging software and life sciences including Omada Health, Benchling and uBiome. The firm raised $1.5bn for its fourth fund in early 2014, a little over two years on from its last recent fundraise. Andreessen Horowitz Fund IV has been following a similar strategy to its predecessor funds as a multi-stage venture capital vehicle.</p>

  <p class="text-info">Pt Capital, an Alaska-based private equity firm focusing on investments in the Arctic region, has held the first close of its inaugural fund on $125m.</p>
  <p>Pt Arctic Fund I was backed by international investors as well as Acrtic-based businesses. The vehicle’s investment priority will be companies in Alaska, Canada, Greenland and Iceland, which the firm identifies as the emerging markets of the Arctic. Hugh Short, chairman and CEO of Pt Capital, said, “The general partners’ financial commitment to the fund, [of] about 15 per cent of funds raised so far, indicates our belief in the long-term value creation available in the Arctic.”</p>
  <p>Mead Treadwell, president of Pt Capital, commented, “The Arctic has seen large economic growth in recent years. GDP in our investment space has grown at a compounded annual growth rate of 5.8 per cent for the last fifteen years, outpacing many emerging markets.”
Founded in 2013, Pt Capital is looking to tap the potential of the Arctic region, the investment in which is expected to grow to more than $100bn by 2022, according to a Lloyds Bank study. Best investment opportunities are seen in the development of natural resources, services and support, and infrastructure.

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter3-article9"></a><h2>Gerchen Keller closes third fund with overwhelming support from existing LPs</h2>
  <p class="text-info">Chicago-based private equity firm Gerchen Keller Capital, has closed its third fund on more than $411m, AltAssets understands.</p>
  <p>The firm was originally targeting $400m and decided to cap the oversubscribed vehicle on a little bit over $411m, a source told AltAssets. The fundraising environment has been good and the new vehicle enjoyed overwhelming support from returning investors, with well more than half of existing LPs re-upping.
Investors include fund of funds, pension funds and endowments from the US. While participating LPs are 63 as stated in the SEC filing, the actual number is smaller, the source said. This is because some of the institutional investors who have made a larger commitment to the fund are being represented by several individual LPs in the form D. 
</p>
  <p>The fund has a fairly large institutional base but a small concentrated number of investors, the source said.
No deals have been made or planned for Fund III yet, as the investment period for the predecessor vehicle is expiring at the end of this year. Transactions for the new fund will be considered as early as January 2016, according to the source. Fund III comes nearly two years since the closing of its predecessor, GKC Partners II, which raised $250m in January 2014. 
</p>
  <p>At that time the vehicle brought its total assets under management to more than $300m, although the firm’s website now states it has around $800m AUM.
GKC helps companies and law firms manage costs and expand working capital; de-risk legal exposures; and monetize fees, judgments, and settlements. According to CEO Adam Gerchensaid, the previous fund received commitments from large public pension funds, university endowments and family office institutions in the US, although it is unclear whether any have re-upped.

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter3-article10"></a><h2>Paladin expects to close Cyber Fund next summer</h2>
  <p class="text-info">US private equity firm Paladin Capital is to hold the final close for its Cyber Fund sometime in the summer of 2016, targeting an amount of $300m, a spokesperson for the firm told AltAssets.</p>
  <p>The first closing of the vehicle was held in September on $70m and Paladin was happy with the fundraising environment with many investors interested in getting on board. LPs can see the investment opportunity in the cyber security sector because there is a huge wave of urgent spending taking place on improving cyber resilience both by governments and the public sector, the spokesperson said. Governmental spending alone on cyberwarfare will exceed $10bn this year and the bulk is being allocated to cyber security specifically, they added.</p>
  <p>Paladin will use the fund for investments in both the US and Europe and recently appointed a dedicated team to work on deals in the European markets. It has already done some investing in Europe. The firm has already closed some deals from the new fund and has a few lined-up deals to close in the near future as well, according to the spokesperson. The average ticket size per deal is around $20m.</p>
  <p>UK European hot spot for cyber security investments</p>
  <p>Great Britain has been identified as the most interesting cyber security market in Europe, as it “has a well-developed ecosystem of tech start-ups and entrepreneurs in this space”, the spokesperson said. The market is fragmented and Paladin’s strategy is to invest in the most innovative start-ups and then help them scale up, using the knowledge and deep networks we have developed in cyber security over the past 10 years. There is a significant opportunity to create value in this market, according to the spokesperson. </p>
  <p>On 17 November, UK’s Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne gave a speech about cyber security, commending Paladin’s efforts in the field. Osborne said, “If Britain is to be a world leader in cyber, and stay at the cutting edge of cyber technology, we need the innovation and vigour that only these companies can offer. We need to create a commercial ecosystem in which cyber start-ups proliferate, get the investment and support they need, and are helped to win business around the world (…) And I am delighted that Paladin Capital has just announced it is establishing a dedicated cyber fund in the UK; we can be proud that they have chosen London as its base.”</p>
  <p>Paladin believes now is the right timing to invest in Europe as a whole, since local technology start- ups are providing innovative solutions and products to bolster cyber security. Commenting on potential risks in this sector of the market, the spokesperson said that spending on cyber security will be unlimited for many years to come so the market backdrop is very positive.</p>

  <p class="text-info">European buyout major Permira may be looking into starting fundraising for its next flagship vehicle, targeting €6bn.</p>
  <p>The firm is rumoured to be mulling over the launch of its sixth fund in the first quarter of next year, according to a report by PEHub, citing three LPs. The hard cap for the fund is set at €7bn, the report says. Permira was not immediately available for comment. The firm held the final close for its Fund V on €5.3bn in June 2014, after 34 months of fundraising. The vehicle closed on a reduced hard cap, which was lowered from the initial €6.5bn. Fund V was launched in early 2011, but had collected just €2bn 18 months later according to a letter to investors at the time. The firm said 72 per cent of the capital came from previous fund backers, although that figure comes in the context of Fund IV gathering €11.1bn in 2006.</p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter3-article13"></a><h2>Ardian raises €1.1bn for fourth co-investment fund</h2>
  <p class="text-info">French independent private investment firm Ardian has raised €1.1bn for its latest co-investment vehicle preparing for future collaborative deals.</p>
  <p>More than 50 international investors have backed the fourth fund, which is significantly larger than its predecessor vehicle, which closed on €730m in 2007. The fund is split between two pools, covering dollars and euros, so that investors are able to choose their exposure to the US and European markets. This structure has encouraged a diverse global investor base, including insurance companies and pensions funds, as well as more than 30 family offices. Notably, more than half of investors in the fund are investors new to Ardian.</p>
  <p>The team will continue its strategy of taking minority positions in private equity deals across the world, with the possibility of being more active through board representation for some transactions, notably in Europe. Dominique Gaillard, member of the executive committee, head of direct funds at Ardian, said, “This major achievement is a testimony of the quality of our performance. This is further reflected in the large number of investors new to the fund and to Ardian.”</p>
  <p>Alexandre Motte, head of co-investment at Ardian, added, “The high number of family offices investing in this fund confirms the growing demand for co-investment. Our investors value the direct exposure to private companies all over the world in various sectors alongside high-quality majority shareholders. As in our previous generations, we will continue our strategy of leveraging Ardian’s network, as well as its strong presence in the US.”</p>
  <p>This month, Ardian sold its minority stake in electrical safety equipment company Novarc which the firm invested in 2012. In September, the French private equity investor raised €2bn for its third private debt fund, seven years after the last such vehicle was closed.</p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter3-article15"></a><h2>Luxcara expecting to exceed €250m third fund target, exec says</h2>
  <p class="text-info">German renewable energy-focused asset manager Luxcara expects to break the €250m target at the final close of its third fund slated for February 2016 according to co-founder and managing director Kathrin Oechtering.</p>
  <p>The firm held a first close for the fund at €50m in the middle of September this year, soon after the vehicle’s launch. A second close is set to be held by the end of this month, followed by a third close in mid-December. The final close is expected early next year and according to Oechtering, bringing an end to an oversubscribed fundraise which could even see the vehicle hit its hard cap of €300m. At the end, the Flaveo Infrastructure Europe – Solar and Wind fund should have total assets under management of some €1.3bn.</p>
  <p>The provided capital stems entirely from German LPs who are keen on investing in renewables, a sector with a good risk-return profile, Oechtering commented. One existing investor has already backed the third fund and the rest of existing LPs are currently “looking at it and are probably coming back in the first quarter of 2016,” she said. There is also interest seen from new institutional investors including pension funds and insurance companies as the sector is getting more popular among LPs.   </p>
  <p>Oechtering explained, “Things have changed over the past few years, investors who did not look at infrastructure and renewable energy before now have an appetite for such deals. It has become more common to have a stake invested in renewables, as there are good opportunities in the sector and returns are very decent, around 5.5 per cent net. This is more attractive for German investors though, while international LPs are typically targeting higher returns.”</p>
  <p>So far, Luxcara has used the third vehicle for the acquisition of wind energy portfolios in Germany in October and a portfolio of five solar plants in the UK. The buy of the first solar plant in Great Britain was closed last Friday. Apart from Germany other key target markets for the fund, which will invest in solar and wind assets exclusively in Europe, are Scandinavia, the UK and France. Depending on the opportunities presented by each of the markets, Luxcara will decide in where to invest.</p>
  <p>It could be an even split between solar and wind but this is not necessarily a requirement. At the end it may be more solar than wind of vice versa. In any case the fund has a 25 per cent minimum threshold for investments in each of the two sectors. The markets are indeed changing very quickly because of changing regulation for renewable energy such as reduction of FiTs,” Oechtering said.” In her assessment the market offering the most interesting opportunities for future investments is Scandinavia in the West. In Eastern Europe, the situation looks good in Poland especially, she said.
The fund will be tapped to buy whole portfolios, meaning there could be one closing for several acquired facilities. Oechtering expects to have enough capital for the acquisition of 5-10 portfolios.
</p>
  <p>Luxcara one-stop shop for investing in renewables</p>
  <p>Oechtering said, “The most interesting characteristic of our firm is that we are investing in renewable energy only and have done so from the beginning. We cover every aspect in a project’s lifecycle including long term asset management – we source the deals, we structure them, we acquire the assets, we finance and we manage them. The lifetime of an assetcould be up to 20 years or longer. This is all done in-house. Thanks to that expertise we can be very quick and source good deals because we have a long-term track record. Luxcara is very well prepared to assess the risks in the market correctly and take measures to prevent them. </p>
  <p>“We [Oechtering and Luxcara co-founder Alexandra von Bernstorff] have been in the field since 2005 and Luxcara was set up in 2009. Alexandra and I have been working together since 2007.”
The German asset manager raised its second renewables dedicated fund in 2011 at €165m. Two years before that it launched its first renewables fund not disclosing the committed capital. Luxcara’s currently has €2bn in renewable assets under management.

  <p class="text-info">London-based private equity firm Hollyport Capital has closed its fifth secondaries-focused fund at its £187.5m hard cap, just five months after launching.</p>
  <p>Hollyport Secondary Opportunities V received strong support from existing investors and number of new established institutional investors according to statement by the firm. The fund was launched in June with a £150m target and closes almost two years after its predecessor, Hollyport Secondary Opportunities IV. Fund IV closed in December 2013 at its hard cap of £75m, beating its target of £50m. Like its predecessors, Hollyport said that Fund V will acquire parcels of mature private equity fund interests from investors who have already received the substantial majority of the value that these investments will generate.</p>
  <p>Chief executive John Carter said, “Private equity secondary market transaction volume remains robust, and we are seeing a significant number of vendors taking advantage of buoyant markets to rationalise their private equity portfolios. We have a strong pipeline of investment opportunities, and have recently expanded the team to accommodate this increase in deal volume.”
He added that the firm expects to complete a number of investments in Hollyport V before the end of the year.

  <p class="text-info">French low-to-mid market investor Initiative & Finance expects its recently-closed second fund to stem up to 25 acquisitions of local SMEs in its lifetime, the firm’s president Jean-Bernard Meurisse told AltAssets.</p>
  <p>Initiative & Finance held the first and final close of the second vehicle on €168m earlier this month and will use the raised capital for investments exclusively in the French SME sector, aiming at an average ticket size of around €6m, Meurisse said. This is a bit higher than the average ticket written for investments for the predecessor vehicle FCPR I, which was around €5m. Meurisse said, “Our investment strategy for Fund II will remain the same but we will slightly increase the average investment amount per deal because historically we have gradually increased the amount we have put in. Initially it was €2m to €3m and before Fund I it was up to €4m and for FCPR I we raised it to €5m. Now, with the second fund, we are aiming at around €6m. It is a slow evolution in terms of amounts and is really continuity as we are targeting the same type of businesses.”</p>
  <p>Initiative & Finance invests in majority and minority interests in French SMEs with revenues of €5m to €100m, writing tickets between €1m and €10m and completing an average of 10 transactions per year. The firm has one deal agreed for Fund II already and is expecting to close it in the next two weeks, Meurisse said. The acquired business is related to the construction sector.
French bank Banque Publique d’Investissement (BPI) and European Investment Fund (EIF) are among the investors backing the second fund, which is supported almost entirely by existing LPs.
</p>
  <p>FCPR I, Initiative & Finance’s first fund which closed on €140m in 2010, has invested in 27 small businesses across France. So far, there have been four exits which have brought proceeds equal to 60 per cent of the fund’s size, Meurisse said. Current net IRR for FCPR I stands at above 10 per cent but it is “not very significant to date” because of the low number of exits, he said.</p>
  <p>“Till the end of September the fund was still not fully invested, we did two deals recently. We had only four exits on 25 per cent shareholdings and the term of the shareholdings was quite short, with average maturity of less than two years. We value our portfolio companies very carefully during the life of an investment. Before exits we always value very conservatively and we always aim at exits significantly above the last valuation. So current net IRR is not definitive at this point. Most of the proceeds from the four exits done so far was distributed to LPs while part was recycled to finance management fees or additional investments, as we have reached a very high level of investment in Fund I.”</p>
  <p>Initiative & Finance raised the first fund after its spinout from French bank Natixis, which sold its private equity businesses to AXA Private Equity, now known as Ardian, for €507m five years ago. Prior to that Initiative & Finance was investing own balance sheet money from a subsidiary of Natixis called Initiative & Finance Investissement. Meurisse said, “When we spun out from Natixis we had to raise the first fund to be able to continue with our investment activity.</p>
  <p>“For more than 20 years we had to operate as a captive investor on own balanced sheet with an evergreen vehicle, then five years ago we converted to third-party management because our shareholder sold the investment part of the business to Ardian and the board of directors bought out the management part. For the past five years we have been an independent player in the French private equity market, owned by the management.”</p>

  <p class="text-info">Mid Europa, one of the largest PE investors in the CEE region, has invested almost a third of the capital in its Fund IV and the co-investment vehicle it raised a year ago, founder and managing partner Thiery Baudon has told AltAssets.</p>
  <p>The firm closed it fourth fund on €800m and a co-investment facility of another €650m in October 2014, making the total available capital €1.45bn. “We have put to work, including co-investments, just under €400m already. To invest everything that we raised in 2014 we will need about five years, so I expect us to return to the market sometime in 2017/18,” Baudon said.
Mid Europa has continued its usual exit strategy over the past year and a half and had a few divestments from Fund II and Fund III, with Fund II now almost fully depleted at this point.
</p>
  <p>Baudon said, “We have two or three exits per year on average, and this has been the case in the last 18 months, no change on that front. The deals came from our previous two funds and Fund II has been almost completely divested now with just one asset left. Fund II should come to an end in the next six to twelve months. Both Fund II and Fund III are doing well in terms of performance despite being vintages which were caught by the financial crisis. As many other private equity investors we had more problems with fundraising in the period 2012-2014 rather than the in the first years of the crisis since 2007, so the raising of Fund IV was certainly more challenging than that of Fund III.”</p>
  <p>Mid Europa closed Fund III on €1.5bn in August 2007. The vehicle has made 12 investments. Exactly two years before that, in August 2005, the firm held the final close of Fund II on €655m, which has stemmed seven deals. Fund II was raised following the management buyout and forming of Mid Europa as an independent firm. Since the buyout, the firm has raised three institutional private equity funds targeting the CEE region. To date, Mid Europa has 31 investments across 18 countries in Central Europe and Turkey and has deployed capital of around €4.2bn.
Currently, the firm has 18 investments in its portfolio, with more recent acquisitions made in countries such as the Czech Republic and Romania.

  <p class="text-info">Mexican venture capital firm IGNIA could hold a second close for Fund II by the end of the year end as fundraising is going very well, firm managing partner Alvaro Rodriguez told AltAssets.</p>
  <p>The social enterprise-focused venture capital investor held a first close for the vehicle earlier this month, raising $90m for impact investing in Mexico. IGNIA says Fund II is the first ever venture capital fund that has received support from Mexican pension funds. Rodriguez said, “We have received backing from those funds because of our track record, our team and our investment approach. I also think the funds have recognised the tremendous opportunities there are currently in venture capital in Mexico, especially at the base of the socio-economic pyramid where we are focusing our investments.”</p>
  <p>While the first close has been supported entirely by pension funds, Rodriguez expects future closes to receive support from individual as well as institutional investors. Investments will be kept within Mexico, and there are no plans to go across borders for the time being, the managing partner added. IGNIA is currently assessing a number of deals in the focus sectors of healthcare, housing, education, financial, water, energy and communications for the second fund. Rodriguez said, “We are considering several opportunities but have not chosen anything specific yet.”</p>
  <p>He did not rule out the option of making investments before the final closing of Fund II but for now “it is too early to tell” whether there will be any, he added.
The first fund, IGNIA closed closed on $102m in June 2010, significantly above the initial target of $50m to $75m, has been fully deployed. The current net IRRs suggest a very good performance of that vehicle, Rodriguez said without naming a figure. Rodriguez said, “We had three exits from that fund with double digit returns on investment.”</p>
  <p>Investments focused on making a socio-economic impact in Mexico are expected to increase in the future. “There is a huge potential for this type of investments here and we are anticipating more growth in that area over the next years.”
Apart from the Mexico-focused vehicle IGNIA’s Fund II also includes an international vehicle, a Canadian limited partnership fund, which is currently fundraising from international and local investors. The final close of the two vehicles is expected within the next six months.
