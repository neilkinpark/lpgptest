  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter1-article1"></a><h2>PE firms need to be picky about investments amid pricey acquisitions environment</h2>
  <p class="text-info">Private equity firms need to be increasingly wary of picking and choosing the right companies to buy amid a continued increase in acquisition competition, a new report from Partners Group suggests.</p>
  <p>The firm’s H2 2015 market outlook says that although private equity fundraising fell in Q2 2015 to its lowest amount in more than two years, the level of competition on the investment side continued to increase, driving acquisition multiples up and creating a great environment for exits. It said, “Nonetheless, we believe it is still possible to find companies at reasonable prices by focusing on three key themes: the development of platform investments; companies with technology-related advantages; and niche leaders active in resilient business areas, which are ready for international expansion.</p>
  <p>“Additionally, quality assets are now available at lower multiples compared with two years ago in certain emerging markets, especially in Latin America, meaning conditions could be ripe for a new time-to-buy story in these countries.  The report noted that global growth remained tepid, but has become more solid in many parts of the world, partly supported by low oil prices and improving labor markets. “Assuming August’s market correction proves temporary, we may even witness the turn of the rate cycle in the US.</p>
  <p>“Against the backdrop of continued low top-line growth and stretched valuations in certain segments, markets have become more vulnerable. Fundamentals (earnings, margins) will regain importance in driving returns globally, while multiple expansion has run its course. In this environment, we continue to overweight defensive assets and look for growth assets that offer value-creation opportunities as a way to generate returns.” </p>
  <p>Discipline is also required in private real estate according to the report, which pointed to the risk of longer-term market interest rates rising significantly over the year ahead. It said, “While a historical review of the strength of the correlation between cap rate and interest rate movements provides mixed evidence, current pricing and historically low cap rates demand prudent underwriting. </p>
  <p>In this environment, our focus will be on strategies where we can: acquire properties below replacement cost and reposition them; buy, fix and sell properties in areas with supply/demand imbalances; and selectively develop core properties where long-term fundamentals support additional absorption.” Infrastructure has received a boost in recent times as investors flock to the relative stability of the assets class. But the report said avoiding the crowds is a must. </p>
  <p>It said, “While the long-term fundamentals for infrastructure investment remain strong, we have seen further contraction in overall returns. We believe that relative value can still be found in markets with differentiated fundamentals and risk/return dynamics compared to core markets, but that any investment strategy needs to carefully adapt to the buoyant infrastructure capital environment.</p> 
  <p>“We look for investment opportunities that fit three key investment strategies: finding assets with value creation potential; building out market-leading infrastructure platforms; and investing in assets in transitional markets, where the tailwinds created by change lend support.”</p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter1-article2"></a><h2>PE fundraising across Central, Eastern Europe soars as rest of continent slips</h2>
  <p class="text-info">Private equity fundraising in the CEE region increased more than three-fold in last year, bucking the trend in the rest of Europe according to new research.</p>
  <p>Private equity and venture capital ﬁrms raised €1.47bn for investment in CEE in 2014, the highest level since 2008 and the fourth best result ever, the figures from EVCA’s latest statistics report show. It said, “As is frequently the case for the region, fundraising is driven by whether CEE fund managers are in or out of the market. The 2014 ﬁgures were driven largely by an established CEE private equity manager that closed its fourth fund as well as a new entrant into the region that won a signiﬁcant ﬁnancial commitment from a Chinese investor investing in the region for the ﬁrst time.”</p>
  <p>In contrast, private equity fundraising across the rest of Europe fell by 18 per cent, the report says. As a result, the CEE share of total European fundraising rose to 3.3 per cent from just 0.8 per cent in 2013, and also eclipsed the 2.8 per cent level achieved in 2012, reﬂecting rising appetite among international investors for the region. Government agencies remained the leading source of capital in 2014 according to the research, accounting for €617m – 42 per cent – of the total CEE result.</p>
  <p>The figure included a major contribution from a Chinese public source, the first investment by a Chinese investor of such magnitude into a private equity fund in the region. In absolute terms, funding from government agencies more than tripled from €197m in 2013. EVCA said, “This marks the third year in a row when government agencies were the main contributor to CEE fundraising. “In comparison, the rest of Europe clearly shows a different fundraising pattern, with pension funds as the leading source of funds at 27 per cent of total funds raised in Europe overall.</p>
  <p>“Sovereign wealth funds were the second largest investor in funds targeted at the CEE region, accounting for 16 per cent of all capital raised, or €241m. The last time sovereign wealth investors accounted for a material amount of capital in CEE fundraising was in 2007.” Fund of funds accounted for 13 per cent of the 2014 CEE fundraising total according to EVCA, while pension funds contributed 11 per cent of capital raised. In value terms, the total combined investments from pension funds and funds of funds surged in 2014, increasing four-fold versus 2013 to €346m, indicating a return to the CEE market of these important non-governmental sources of capital.</p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter1-article3"></a><h2>Q&A: Cairngorm’s Andrew Steel talks up the UK market in wake of maiden fund close</h2>
  <p class="text-info">Earlier this week UK private equity newcomer Cairngorm Capital held a £50m first and final close for its maiden fund, just a year after launching. Managing partner Andrew Steel, previously a founder member of HIG Capital’s London team, offers his perspective on the UK private equity market, what investors are looking and the role Cairngorm can play as a newcomer to the market.</p>
  <p>Given this was a first time fund, how hard did you find it to raise capital? </p>
  <p>It is easy to raise capital in relatively small amounts for very discrete purposes. I didn’t initially intend on raising capital on a formal basis as I didn’t think I had established the structure that investors typically look for in a private equity fund. I am the only partner, I am very focused on what I do and I am more of an industrial investor than a private equity guy.</p>
  <p>So I hadn’t really planned to raise a formal fund, but as I started to look at some investment opportunities I was introduced to a few specialist providers of funding and that led to a number of inquiries about Cairngorm Capital, which led us to decide that we would raise a small fund.</p>
  <p>It was relatively straightforward, although it is probably easier to raise more than less and we had to exclude a number of investors, who we would have loved to have had, because they wanted to write big tickets – which was difficult for us to accommodate within a sensibly sized fund. In the end we ended up with three major investors, two are European funds of funds and one was a US endowment.</p>
  <p>What are investors looking for?</p>
  <p>I think investors are looking for different things. Some are more than happy to put large amounts into mega cap buyout funds. But there others who are looking for superior multiple returns and some investors see these higher returns coming in the lower mid-market. Investors can find companies that have potential for sustainable growth and where it’s possible to add value to management teams to support them in their ambitions to grow revenues, expand margins or to help consolidate industries through buy and build.</p>
  <p>That investment thesis is quite easy for institutions to understand but it doesn’t allow for vast amounts of money to be deployed. If you are buying businesses for £40m to £50m, those are the kind of businesses where it’s possible to make a five- to 10-times return, but obviously you can’t deploy hundreds of millions of pounds of capital into those. I think the smaller funds with a really focused strategy have historically generated good multiple returns, so investor appetite is high in that category.</p>
  <p>What will be the investment strategy for the new fund?</p>
  <p>We are looking to do two to three investments in this fund and it is likely that they will be in the UK. I like mature industries, I like businesses that have an enterprise value of between £30m and £100m. I find those businesses are big enough to be real companies but small enough to need managerial help and input. They are often faced with growth opportunities but are limited with their resources needed to exploit those opportunities. So that’s what we look for.</p>
  <p>We look for a company that is a great regional business that would like to be national but needs help getting there. We look for the businesses with one or two products but wants five or six, so it needs support to enable that. We look for a two per cent to three per cent EBITDA business in an industry where the leaders are making 12 per cent to 15 per cent. They tend to be mature industries, especially manufacturers, distributors or service companies that are in mature cash generative segments.</p>
  <p>From your experience, how does the UK compare to the rest of Europe and across the pond?</p>
  <p>The UK is a particularly interesting market, the macro economical environment in the UK is pretty attractive at this time and there are many businesses which remain under-managed, creating compelling opportunities for Cairngorm Capital to help. What’s less compelling is there is a huge amount of money chasing this space and pricing has got a bit elevated. </p>
  <p>There are also an awful lot of intermediaries brokering businesses, so those are potential negatives compared to other geographies. But I think there are still plenty of opportunities here in the UK. One of the reasons why I like the relatively small business scale is because self-evidently there are far more of those businesses than there are larger business, so the opportunity set is much larger.</p>
  <p>What does the future hold for Cairngorm?</p>
  <p>We have deliberately kept the fund size small so we can invest it in the next couple of years and in parallel build out the investment team, and then raise a bigger fund in two to three years’ time. It’s a start up but obviously we have a very experienced team, myself and Lee Hess have 50-plus years of experience in running real businesses, as well as an extended period in private equity. Cairngorm Capital is a construct designed to build on my general manager experience plus seven years with a best in class private equity firm and really bring together those two sets of skills to try and build a unique Institution that endures for the long-term.</p>
  <p>For the time being we will be focusing on the UK. I spent eight years in North America, working in real companies such as Home Depot (founded in 1978 and now a Dow constituent with EV of $150bn-plus) and running factories for an industrial and building materials group. So I am very familiar with the international markets and I will be excited in due course, to expand Cairngorm Capital and its international reach, but for now we are focused on a concentrated basis.</p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter2-article1"></a><h2>Texas teachers’ pension fund to open office in London</h2>
  <p class="text-info">In what is being seen by some industry observers as an unusual move for a US pension fund, the Teacher Retirement System of Texas is to set to open an office in London.</p>
  <p>The TRS said the new office, to be located at 14 Curzon Street in London’s central and pricey Mayfair district, is expected to increase the number of investment opportunities available to its investment managers, “particularly in co-investments”, according to a statement released last week. Mayfair is home to a number of private equity companies and hedge funds, as well as numerous embassies and consulates, including, for now, the American embassy.</p>
  <p>The office, which will open in November, will be TRS’s first outside the US, and is being established “after considerable due diligence and discussions with the TRS Board of Trustees and other stakeholders”, according to the statement. Coming from TRS’s Austin headquarters to head up the new office will be Vaughn Brock, pictured, who was named director of special projects at the company seven months ago. Before this he was director of TRS’s Energy and Natural Resource Portfolio for two and a half years.</p>
  <p>According to board chairman R David Kelly, TRS felt that having an office in London would give the firm “a strategic advantage in terms of identifying investment opportunities in the United Kingdom and Europe that can deliver greater returns at a lower cost to our members”. By opening a London office, we will redeploy existing resources so they are closer to where the action is,” added TRS executive director Brian Guthrie. “This will also help us reduce unnecessary travel back and forth from Austin. </p>
  <p>“Even though our London presence will be small – only three people – we’ll be ready to hit the ground running to identify new investment opportunities in real time.” TRS said it had studied the question of a London office as part of a strategic initiative led by deputy chief investment officer Jerry Albright, assisted by Guthrie and chief investment officer Britt Harris. The TRS oversees around $131bn in assets, which are owned jointly by the more than 1.4 million public education and higher education employees and retirees in Texas who participate in the pension system.</p>
  <p>This averages out as around one in 20 of the state’s residents. The TRS’s decision to open an office in London – one of the world’s most international investment centres – comes, experts say, as a growing number of attractive investment opportunities for American pension fund managers are taking place outside of the US, in overseas and emerging markets. At a time when, as now, large amounts of “dry powder” are chasing a limited number of desirable deals, and prices are high, competition for the best investments can be particularly intense, industry experts add.</p>
  <p>This is probably one reason that, as reported in an interview with TRS’s senior managing director of private markets Eric Lang, which appears in the most recent edition of AltAssets’ sibling publication, Limited Partner Magazine, TRS has been looking to increase the percentage of its portfolio that it holds overseas. “Historically we have been very much in the US, but our long-term target is 55 to 70 per cent in the US, five per cent to 15 per cent in emerging markets, and the remainder in international developed [markets],” Lang was quoted as saying.</p>
  <p>In the same article, Lang’s TRS colleague, Neil Randall, a senior director in the firm’s Private Equity Group, stressed the importance of “strong partnerships with our managers” – something that, although he doesn’t say so, is generally thought to be easier to achieve when LPs and GPs aren’t on other sides of the planet.</p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter2-article2"></a><h2>Limited Partners’ trade group calls for more uniform PE reporting</h2>
  <p class="text-info">The Institutional Limited Partners Association,  which represents more than 300 pension funds and other private equity fund investors globally, is launching an effort to establish “more robust and consistent standards for fee and expense reporting and compliance disclosures among investors, fund managers and their advisers”.</p>
  <p>In a statement released on last week, the Toronto-based organisation describes its new Fee Transparency Initiative as a broad-based effort that is employing an undisclosed number of senior investment and reporting professionals, drawn from a cross-section of investor institutions and advisers, to produce new “industry guidance as it relates to reporting and transparency over both the near and long term”.</p>
  <p>The ILPA said the new guidance would build on its existing reporting guidelines, which were first issued in 2011, and which identify “the essential elements to be included in quarterly financial reporting, and in capital call and distribution notices”.  The first element of the new ILPA initiative will be a reporting template that details, at the level of an individual limited partner investor, all monies paid to the fund manager (general partner, or GP) and its affiliates – including fees, expenses and incentive compensation, for example, the GP’s share of the profit, (also known as carried interest), the ILPA said.</p>
  <p>This template is currently in development, with a first draft due to be made available for comment to ILPA members in late September, the ILPA added. It said comments will be invited from the wider industry, including fund managers and advisers, beginning mid-October, with a final version, reflecting input from a cross-section of practitioners, expected to be released sometime in early January of next year.</p>
  <p>The news that ILPA is taking action aimed at establishing a new industry-wide standard for fee and expense reporting comes after a summer of revelations and commentary on what some critics have been saying is a lack of transparency with respect to the way client investors – including the pension funds of thousands of government employees – are charged for the management of their assets. As AltAssets reported, a senior official at the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS) attracted international attention after saying that the country’s largest pension fund by assets didn’t know exactly how much carried interest it had been paying its private equity fund managers.</p>
  <p>The matter of carried interest is a separate topic and has also been a much-discussed one of late, including by such US presidential candidates as Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, even though it’s not, as some private equity veterans have pointed out, a new one. At least one other US presidential candidate, Mitt Romney, brought it up previously – in his case, during the 2012 presidential campaign. Last month, as AltAssets reported, the ILPA was said to be playing down the geographical significance of the appointment, in June, of a Washington-based individual, Peter Freire, as its executive director. Freire’s predecessor had been based in Toronto.</p>
  <p>That report, first carried by Private Equity News, a Dow Jones publication, suggested that the ILPA was planning to increase its activities on behalf of the industry in Washington, DC, “as the industry faces scrutiny over transparency”. In the ILPA’s statement announcing the Fee Transparency Initiative on Thursday, Freire admitted that it was being launched in response to a “confluence of factors”. As the private equity industry adjusted to regulation, investors responded to shortfalls in disclosures by introducing numerous bespoke reporting formats, which has exacerbated the compliance challenge and made benchmarking programme costs and net performance more difficult,” Freire said.</p>
  <p>“ILPA’s members recognise the need for a streamlined and uniform approach that will yield the information required to effectively steward the capital entrusted to them by retirees, governments, and academic institutions.” Under the updated guidelines that the ILPA’s new Fee Transparency Initiative is proposing to provide, individual LPs will be provided with detailed, periodic balances for their share of paid and accrued fees and GP incentive compensation.</p>
  <p>LPs will also receive a clearer picture of manager compensation received from other sources, such as portfolio companies and affiliated entities. In addition to the reporting template, the Fee Transparency Initiative will produce recommendations on the role of third parties (such as administrators, auditors, consultants and attorneys) in ensuring compliance with a fund’s governing documents, the ILPA said. Additionally, the group will propose detailed best practices related to fee and expense reporting and compliance disclosures to be appended to the 2011 ILPA Private Equity Principles.</p>
  <p>The ILPA’s Freire says private equity investors believe that the fees their organisations pay “must be appropriate, arms’ length, reasonable and disclosed”. This [Fee Transparency Initiative] points to a logical and necessary progression for private equity down the path of becoming a more institutionalised asset class,” he added. Transparency around fees and expenses is critically important to our members, and we are pleased to serve as a platform to marshal our members’ collective resources to promote improved disclosure standards that will help LPs make better informed decisions.”</p>
  <p>Mike Mazzola, managing director of MetLife Investments and the ILPA’s chairman, said the organisation’s limited partner members, like his company, counted on their fund managers “not only to produce strong returns that are additive to their portfolios, but also to deliver information in a way that informs bigger picture decisions about performance, cost and portfolio-level risks”., TIAA-CREF said.</p>

  <p>Eugene Investment & Securities Co and Morgan Stanley Smith Barney have been hired to push to fund out LP, with sales commission priced at just over $1.57m. Back in October, AltAssets reported that the vehicle was looking to raise between $2bn and $2bn. The fund is already larger than the $1.3bn it collected for its first in 2012.

  <p>Williams, a managing director of Covera Ventures, has teamed with Mutual Mobile founder Jason Story to launch Hangar, which will aim to help companies raise their first round of institutional capital. The firm is backed by tech investors like John Jaggers, Managing Partner of Sevin Rosen Funds, and David Hunt of Hunt Technology Ventures. Hunt said, “Jeff has been a VC for almost twenty years. He is very seasoned and has seen multiple economic and tech cycles, which is invaluable.</p>
  <p>“Jason is a young, passionate, proven founder, who can actually develop products and has real operational experience. He’s completely immersed in the latest trends in tech. He is living it. That kind of insight is what will make Hangar unique.” A statement from Hangar said its launch was one of many steps needed toward restoring the once large and prominent venture capital community in Texas.</p>
  <p>Williams said, “I don’t see it as Austin vs Dallas, I see it as a regional play that must continue to work together to build great companies. “More importantly, the lack of venture capital creates entrepreneur flight to areas such as Silicon Valley where capital is more abundant. It’s important we do everything we can to maintain a strong ecosystem here to support these entrepreneurs.” </p>

Cloud Apps pulled in 75 percent of the commitments for the fund from institutional investors, with the rest coming from technology executives and investors. To date the firm has already made seven investments, including social media management platform Hootsuite, mobile enterprise company GoFormz and field service management software provider ServiceMax, among others.</p>
  <p>Cloud Apps leads classic Series A financings of $2m to $4m and provides full board support according to the firm. General partner Matt Holleran said, “The venture market today is not optimized for cloud business application companies. New business application companies require more capital and more board support than the seed market can provide. Large venture firms would like to see more traction prior to investing. </p>
  <p>“We know first-hand what it takes to build category-leading business application companies, and we help the entrepreneur to put the fundamentals in place to be successful. We are leading a change in the venture industry with our market-focused Classic Series A approach, and we expect to see more new market-focused venture firms in other categories.” Last month, US early stage investment firm Vertex Ventures pulled in more than $140m for its debut fund. </p>
