  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter1-article1"></a><h2>PE deals grow slightly amid wider secondaries transaction squeeze</h2>
  <p class="text-info">The booming global secondaries market stuttered in the first half of 2015, with completed transactions dropping more than five per cent year on year, Setter Capital research suggests.</p>
  <p>Despite that overall fall, private equity secondaries grew 1.9 per cent in the same period according to Setter Capital’s latest Volume Report, reaching a total of $16.2bn. Real estate secondaries, on the other hand, fell 1.8 per cent, while hedge fund secondaries slid a massive 78.6 per cent, as side pocket supply continue to evaporate, the report said. Energy fund secondaries were also down 78.5 per cent year over year, from $1.6bn to $350m, as falling energy prices caused the bid-ask spread to widen.</p>
  <p>The biggest volume improvement was seen in infrastructure secondaries, growing 28.5 per cent to $614m, as buyers continued to enter this relatively new market. The volume of ‘direct secondaries’ hit $5.5bn according to the report, up 21 per cent year over year, as more managers looked to liquidate or restructure older funds. Setter said, “This is not surprising, given that 45 per cent of respondents felt that more managers attempted to liquidate or restructure older funds in H1 2015 compared to H1 2014.</p>
  <p>“Managers also increasingly turned to the secondary market to explore stapled transactions, as roughly 31 per cent of respondents felt that a materially higher number had sought staples in H1 2015 compared to H1 2014.” On a combined basis, managers of funds across buyout, VC, hedge, fund of funds and secondary funds accounted for roughly 34 per cent of total sale volume, as they used the secondary market to create liquidity.</p>
  <p>Setter added that volume, which is measured in US dollars, may in fact have been approximately the same as last year if it were not for the depreciation in the euro. The report said increasing buyer competition may in part be explained by the increasing level of intermediation in the market – approximately 65.6 per cent ($13.5bn) of total secondary volume involved an intermediary in H1 2015 as compared to a 59 per cent in H1 2014. That marks an increase of 12.5 per cent year over year.</p>
  <p>Setter said, “We expect the level of intermediation to continue to rise in response to the entrance of new agents and as sellers struggle to stay on top of the ever growing buyer universe. “There were a total of 586 transactions in H1 2015, with an average size of approximately $35.1m. “Although the number of transactions was lower than H1 2014, the average deal size increased 49.5 per cent year over year, reflecting the fact that more multi-hundred million-dollar transactions were completed in H1 2015.</p>
  <p>“The marked increase in large deals, the dominance of secondary funds (80.2 per cent of total volume) and the increased market share of large buyers all demonstrate that H1 2015 was a banner first half for the large entrenched secondary players.” </p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter1-article2"></a><h2>UK activity bolsters biotech investment from PE, VC firms</h2>
  <p class="text-info">The value of private equity, venture capital and development capital investment in the global biotechnology sector increased for the second month in a row in July, to reach its highest point of 2015 so far, new research shows.</p>
  <p>Deals worth an aggregate $745m were announced over the four weeks, up 74 per cent on $429m in June and almost five times higher than the $151m recorded in May, according to the latest data from Zephyr published by BvD. Volume also advanced for the second successive month to 23 deals, up from 22 in June and 13 in May.</p>
  <p>In a 12-month comparison, value was significantly higher than the $158m-worth of investment, and volume up 15 per cent on the 20 deals announced in July 2014. A surge in the value of PE, VC and DC investment targeting UK biotech companies boosted global results. Immunocore, an Oxfordshire-based research services company focused on developing treatments for cancer, viral infections and autoimmune disease, raised $320m in its first round of funding.</p>
  <p>Investors included Woodford Investment Management, Malin Corporation and Eli Lilly, and proceeds will be used to advance Immunocore’s pipeline of biologics called Immune mobilising mTCR against cancer. The deal was worth almost twice as much as the second-highest deal by value, which again targeted a UK company. BBI Diagnostics Group 2, a diagnostics reagents developer based in Cardiff, was acquired by Exponent Private Equity for $164m, in a rare private equity buyout in the biotech sector.</p>
  <p>In all, UK companies were targeted in four of the top 20 deals by value, with companies based in the US, France, Switzerland, Hungary, China, Japan, Sweden, Spain and Colombia also targeted. The US led by volume with six transactions, half the 12 deals announced in June, and the lowest recorded in the past 12 months. Volume targeting UK biotech companies doubled over the four weeks to four transactions, while third-placed China increased at the same rate, from one deal in June to two.</p>

  <h1>LP News</h1>
  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter2-article1"></a><h2>CalPERS exec calls for PE company fee disclosure, transparency, industry dialogue</h2>
  <p class="text-info">A top executive of the California Public Employees’ Retirement System  said his company, America’s largest pension fund investor, will require the private equity managers it works with in the future to be transparent about the fees they charge as well as about how much money they’re making from the portfolio companies they own.</p>
  <p>CalPERS chief investment officer Ted Eliopoulos’s comments came on Monday during a CalPERS investment committee meeting, and were picked up by a recent number of US publications, including the Wall Street Journal.  They comprised the latest development in the growing global debate over private equity fees that took off earlier this year, after CalPERS executives admitted that they had no idea how much they had been paying their private equity providers in fees for years.</p>
  <p>CalPERS, which looks after $300bn in assets on behalf of current and retired state employees in California, is in the process of installing a new reporting system to better track the fees and expenses it’s paying those those external companies that look after its $30.5bn private equity portfolio. It has also said it plans to cut by more than half the number of private equity fund managers it uses, and that it is likely to consider companies’ fee structures when making its decision as to which ones to keep.</p>
  <p>In his comments on Monday, Eliopoulos said CalPERS is working with the Institutional Limited Partners Association, a trade organisation representing fund investors, to come up with a package of information that private equity firms should be willing to disclose to their clients. He also indicated that the pension fund is engaged in talks with fellow institutional investors about how best to develop a best practices approach, according to press reports.</p>
  <p>CalPERS officials didn’t immediately reply to AltAssets’ requests for comment on Wednesday. In its online coverage of Eliopoulos’s comments, Chief Investment Officer magazine said that the CalPERS executive had urged the private equity industry to “start soul searching” on the fees issue. “The CIO of America’s largest pension fund is on a mission to scrutinise private equity’s relationship with investors—and wants the industry to do the same thing,” the publication said.</p>
  <p>It quoted Eliopoulos as asking, rhetorically, “What is an appropriate management fee? What level of profit-sharing adequately recognizes a manager’s skill and expertise and also fairly compensates the limited partner for assuming the risk?” As reported, a UK academic estimated earlier this month that the amount of private equity fee payments CalPERS had failed to disclose over an 18-year period totaled “at least $5bn”.</p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter2-article2"></a><h2>APG latest pension fund manager to detail PE fee control efforts</h2>
  <p class="text-info">APG, the largest pension fund manager in the Netherlands, is speaking publicly for the first time about its efforts to ensure that it doesn’t over-pay for its use of private equity asset management services. </p>
  <p>Although it introduced a comprehensive set of around 40 guidelines at the beginning of 2015 – for its managers to use for determining whether a private equity manager’s latest fund might be considered for inclusion in APG’s vast, €416bn investment portfolio – until now the company hadn’t gone public about it, according to APG spokesman Harmen Geers.</p>
  <p>APG decided to speak out after the Netherlands’ No. 2 pension fund manager, PGGM, revealed earlier this month that would stop using private equity asset managers that didn’t fully disclose their fees, and because it felt that it owed it to the 4.5 million Dutch citizens whose pensions it looks after, Geers told AltAssets this week. “We are a pension asset manager, so technically, our clients are pension funds, but we are very much aware of the millions of ordinary Dutch people who rely on our performance for their pensions,” Geers added.</p>
  <p>Growing international publicity and criticism about the opacity and lack of knowledge of private equity fees, was another factor, he admitted. What APG believes is unique in the private equity-investing industry about its approach to the fee dilemma is a proprietary “metric” it has developed, to enable its in-house managers to evaluate, in a sophisticated way, a range of factors having to do with an external asset manager’s investment offering, rather than having an entire deal come down to a percentage point or two in the performance fee category.</p>
  <p>This, APG believes, enables it to avoid a potentially damaging, one-size-fits-all approach to fees and other charges, Geers explains. That’s because this so-called FPAV (“fees as a percentage of added value”) Metric focuses on performance, which is where Geers says APG believes “the fee conversation should be very much be tilted towards”. “The first step is to ask the [private equity fund manager] to provide us with their estimate of what they expect their return will be, and what they are proposing their fees to be,” Geers says.</p>
  <p>“Then we make our own judgement as to what we think their return will be – and then we feed it all into our FPAV metric, which gives us a reading that lets us know whether or not to proceed with the mandate.” The advantage to this, Geers continues, is that it is designed in such a way that allowances are and can be made for different investment styles, as well as the inherently different types of returns different asset classes and asset types can generate. APG’s efforts to focus on private equity fees date back at least to 2011, when it sold its 50 per cent stake in AlpInvest Partners, at that time a €32bn private equity manager to the US-based Carlyle Group. (PGGM, which owned the other half, sold its stake at the same time.)</p>
  <p>According to press reports of the time, AlpInvest was then Europe’s biggest investor in private equity funds, with investments in more than 200 firms, including TPG, KKR and Blackstone. “The sale of AlpInvest cleared the way for us to begin doing private equity in house,” Geers says. “So that’s when we drew up our first set of “fee principles”, to enable us to explain to fund managers what our view was on things like management fees, performance fees, transparency and so on.”</p>
  <p>As AltAssets reported earlier this month,  PGGM recently posted a two-page document on its website which spells out its new stance on the remuneration of “external parties that we engage to manage part of the assets of pension funds”. The document bears the signature of PGGM chief investment officer for private markets Ruulke Bagijn. The issue of private equity fees and lack of transparency has ramped up in recent years, particularly from the side of the pension funds that, over the last 10 to 15 years, have been increasing their use of alternative assets in an effort to boost returns.</p>
  <p>Because these funds’ money ultimately belongs, in many cases, to the taxpayer-funded pension plans of public entities, pension fund managers are increasingly finding themselves being asked to detail, and justify, the fees they’ve been paying. Pension fund industry critics were emboldened earlier this year after the largest pension fund in the US, CalPERS, admitted it didn’t know how much it had paid in private equity fees –  carried interest in particular – over two decades. This was followed by a similar admission on the part of CalSTRS, another California pension fund giant.</p>
  <p>The US securities regulator has begun to investigate and issue warnings, while California’s state treasurer, John Chiang, has expressed concern. On 5 August, an Australian financial publication reported growing calls for Australia’s regulator, to, in its words, “crack down on the disclosure of fees by private equity firms, amid fears local super funds and investors are being gouged”.</p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter2-article3"></a><h2>Hermes GPE’s Gale: ‘transparency is THE answer to the PE fee dilemma’</h2>
  <p class="text-info">When Hermes GPE announced recently that it had been awarded a £1bn private equity mandate by BT’s pension scheme, the company mentioned in passing that the allocation was to be “split evenly between funds and co-investments”.   </p>
  <p>Now, those who work in financial services are never surprised to see asset managers – of all people – diversifying their investments and strategies. (“Hedge” funds, after all, were invented to enable investors to “hedge” their investment “bets”.) But Hermes GPE head of private equity Peter Gale, told AltAssets that this 50 per cent allocation to co-investments wasn’t just a question of diversification, but also a matter of control. </p>
  <p>This is because co-investing allows LPs a more active way of participating in the asset class than simply choosing a manager or a fund to back. “An LP effectively hands control over to a GP when investing in a typical blind pool private equity fund, and plays no further role in where or when its money is actually invested,” Gale explained. </p>
  <p>“[So] we use a co-invest strategy to retain that control. We get to choose when the money goes in, and where it goes – ie, into areas that will generate alpha, given a particular point in the cycle. Co-investing really helps us to gain control for our clients.” But this use of co-investing is easier said than done, according to Gale. One problem for many LPs, he noted, is that they are pension fund managers, not asset managers, in the way that Hermes GPE – given its fund-of-funds structure – is, so for them, co-investing can be a challenge.</p>
  <p>“You need deal flow, investment expertise, and an investment process in order to do co-investments properly,” he said. “If you’ve got that, as we do, it really does make sense: it’s one of the reasons our realised IRRs are in the 30s, which is probably double what we would be getting if we were only doing private equity funds by themselves.”</p>
  <p>It’s become difficult to discuss private equity investing for very long without wandering into an area that has been receiving a considerable amount of press coverage lately: private equity fees – both how high they are, and how they are often not fully disclosed to their limited partner clients. (Because it is a private equity fund-of-funds manager, Hermes GPE deals with private equity firms on behalf of its clients, putting it squarely on the LP side of the debate.)</p>
  <p>What began last year as a growing debate in US private equity circles about what critics there said was a serious lack of fee transparency has begun to be popping up as a concern in other countries – first in Australia, on 4 August, and then in the Netherlands a day or so later. PGGM, the Dutch pension fund giant, posted on its website a statement outlining its “new guidelines” on the matter, and explaining why it would no longer invest in any outside money managers that didn’t fully disclose their fees.</p>
  <p>PGGM’s announcement came just weeks after two major California state employee pension funds – CalSTRS and CalPERS – admitted that they didn’t know how much they had paid in fees to their private equity managers for decades, prompting the state’s treasurer to announce an investigation into the matter. Gale, who has been with Hermes GPE and its predecessor vehicles for more than 25 years, said he wasn’t looking to pick a battle with the private equity houses, and also couldn’t comment specifically on Hermes GPE’s own fee relationships.</p>
  <p>Nevertheless, he stressed that Hermes GPE “believe in transparency, and always have done, and we try to make it happen, whether through working via a co-investment arrangement or a fund investment. Transparency is good, once the full facts are out on the table, it is then up to the individual trustee bodies – that is, the limited partners – to decide whether they are getting value for their money: Are the net returns they’re receiving worth the amount of fee they’re actually paying?</p>
  <p>“Until you get the numbers in front of you, it’s impossible to make that judgement. Now that we are starting to [get the numbers], greater transparency is starting to occur. And I think you’ll find that this will spread, which is a good thing.” That said, another reason Hermes GPE is keen to make use of co-investing is because the widespread industry practice, whereby GPs charge an upfront fee on investments that “haven’t taken place but which are due to”, is still currently the norm, Gale said.</p>
  <p>“For LPs, this is very expensive, because there aren’t any assets yet on the ground – it is a classic ‘J Curve’ situation.” A J curve is when a line representing an entity’s assets initially curves downward to the right, like the letter “J”, typically well below the level at which it started, before heading up again, ideally well above the break-even point. “I have yet to meet a trustee body or LP who doesn’t find this issue important. It is uncontroversial. Because, apart from anything else, when fees are as high as they often are, it can meaningfully harm the net investment result.” </p>
  <p>This is why Hermes GPE alighted on co-investing “years ago”, Gale said, adding that “over 50 per cent of what we do now is co-investment”. But he adds that lower costs are an additional benefit. Generally, co-investments are made on a no fee, or lower fee, basis.</p>
  <p>“What it does is enable us to ameliorate the impact of the commitment fee structure.” Adamant that he is about the importance of fee transparency in the private equity industry, Gale echoes some other industry commentators in arguing that it should be up to LPs to demand the needed transparency – not, as some have suggested in the US and Australia, government regulators. “The nature of private equity is that it is very nimble, it works because it can do very interesting things with business structures, in part because it is out of the publicly-quoted eye,” Gale said. “But it is up to the LPs to ask – which is what is starting to happen now.”</p>
  <p>Hermes GPE is a specialist investor which has invested in private equity on behalf of clients for 25 years. It evolved out of a combining of the private equity businesses of Hermes Fund Managers, which was originally founded to manage the BT pension fund’s assets, and the private equity business of Gartmore, the UK asset manager that ran into difficulty and was acquired by Henderson Global Investors in 2011. Hermes GPE is now jointly owned by the Hermes GPE management team and Hermes Investment Management.</p>
   
  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter2-article4"></a><h2>Consortium of pension plans, SWFs reported mulling £2bn London airport purchase</h2>
  <p class="text-info">A consortium of international pension and sovereign wealth funds – including an arm of the Kuwait Investment Authority, Hermes, and the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan – is reported to be preparing to pay a total of £2bn for a stake in London’s City Airport.</p>
  <p>Thus far none of the companies reported to be involved have formally commented on the report, which thus far has appeared in such London media outlets as the Daily Telegraph, Evening Standard, except to say that they don’t comment on market speculation. A spokeswoman for OTPP said it was “not commenting”. London City Airport is smaller than London’s other, more globally-focused airports, Gatwick and Heathrow, and favoured by many of those working in London’s financial district and Docklands area, because it is easy to get to and from, and in and out of.</p>
  <p>The scramble to bid for it was kicked off earlier this month after its US owner, Global Infrastructure Partners, said it was considering selling its 75 per cent stake. Global Infrastructure Partners is a New York-based infrastructure entity, with around $15.4bn in assets under management, according to its website. It first invested in the airport in 2006.</p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter2-article5"></a><h2>Scottish Investment Bank plans £75m of co-investment through new structure</h2>
  <p class="text-info">The Scottish Investment Bank plans to invest up to £75m in Scottish companies over the next three years after relaunching its co-investment funds.</p>
  <p>SIB has streamlined its funds by reducing them from four vehicles to just two – the Scottish Co-Investment Fund and Scottish Venture Fund. Both vehicles are also widening their deal parameters, with investments ranging from just £10,000 to £1.5m through the SCF, and up to £2m through the SVF, in deals sizes of up to £10m. Investment through the SCF is alongside ‘accredited partners’ who are experienced investors, vetted by SIB.</p>
  <p>Following successful accreditation, the investment partner can lead multiple investment deals alongside SIB, with fast track access to matched funding across a wide investment range into eligible deals. While still led by private sector investors, investment through the SVF does not require an accredited partner. Kerry Sharp, Head of the Scottish Investment Bank, said: “We’ve been monitoring the market and listening to our investors, and the message was clear that companies increasingly need funding to be more flexible than ever before.</p>
  <p>“That’s why we’ve widened the investment parameters and simplified the criteria to benefit both the private sector investors we work with and the companies we invest in. This greater flexibility to invest across a broader range of businesses will enable us to support more companies to reach their full potential, which in turn helps the Scottish economy to grow.” This time last year the firm hired another three people to expand its private equity infrastructure team. Former Rochschild investment banker Babaola Omiyale joined as an investment manager, Lewis Haffey as an investment analyst and Aaron Donoghue as engineering and project operations consultant.</p>

  <p class="text-info">Goldman Sachs has teamed up with global renewable energy development giant SunEdison to launch a $1bn investment vehicle.</p>
  <p>The WSIP Warehouse fund boasts a $300m equity investment from Goldman’s West Street Infrastructure Partners III fund. A statement from the pair said TerraForm Power, a global owner and operator of clean energy power plants, would have an exclusive call right over the fund’s assets. SunEdison CFO Brian Wuebbels said: “SunEdison’s new $1bn warehouse provides incremental capacity for SunEdison to construct and hold assets in advance of drop down to TerraForm Power.</p>
  <p>“The WSIP Warehouse expands our capacity beyond our existing $1.5bn First Reserve Warehouse and the $500m dollar TerraForm Private Warehouse.” Edward Pallesen, head of the Infrastructure Investment Group for the Americas within the Merchant Banking Division at Goldman Sachs, added, “We are excited to partner with SunEdison as we seek to expand our portfolio of investments in solar and wind projects. “SunEdison and TerraForm Power have a proven track record of delivering high quality renewable energy projects, and we are pleased to be able to support their future growth initiatives.”</p>

  <p class="text-info">Carlyle Group has raised over $839m for its second Power Partners fund, just over a year since launching the fund, AltAssets can reveal.</p>
  <p>Carlyle Power Partners II has collected the commitments from 58 LPs according to filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Although it is not clear at this stage how much the vehicle is targeting, the filing does list TCG Securities, Avalon Wealth Management, Etgal Holdings and Butterfield Asset Management as placement agents, with sales commission priced at $933,440 and a finders’ fee at $500,000.</p>
  <p>In June 2014, AltAssets reported that Carlyle had launched the fund. In February, the fund had collected $365m according to US regulatory filing. The filing indicates that Carlyle is bring in commitments from parallel vehicles Carlyle Power Partners II-A and Carlyle Power Partners II-C. The new vehicle is expected to follow its predecessor, which closed in May 2013, by investing in the US power generation sector.</p>
  <p>Its first fund’s portfolio includes the Hopewell and Portsmouth 120 MW coal stoker-fired boiler power generation facilities in Virginia, the 122 MW Midway natural gas-fired simple cycle power plant and the Cedar Bay Generating Plant. Power Partners II has already invested in natural-gas plants operator Southeast PowerGen according to its website.</p>

  <p class="text-info">Mid-market US private equity firm Wasserstein & Co has confirmed it is raising a fourth buyout fund just a year after closing its third flagship vehicle.</p>
  <p>The firm is looking to raise up to $750m for Fund IV according to a pair of filings made with the US securities regulator. No capital has been registered for the vehicle to date, but the filing reveals Wasserstein hopes to complete the raise within the next 12 months. Lazard Freres & Co and Florida Atlantic Services Corp are acting as placement agents for the fundraise, the filing adds. Wasserstein easily beat its $300m target for its third fund in 2014 by pulling in $403m for the final close. </p>
  <p>Deals made using that fund include the acquisition of specialty valves manufacturer High Pressure Equipment Company, communications solutions provider Globecomm Systems and audiobooks business Recorded Books. Predecessor vehicles from Wasserstein include US Equity Partners I, which closed in 1997, and a follow up which closed in 2002. Those two vehicles pulled in a total of $750m. Wasserstein was created in 2001 when it spun out from banking group Wasserstein Perella & Co. The firm focuses on leveraged buyouts with target investments of between $30m and $150m.</p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter3-article4"></a><h2>Gryphon Investors eyes up to $600m for first flagship fund since financial crash</h2>
  <p class="text-info">San Francisco-based Gryphon Investors is back in the market for its first flagship fundraise in almost a decade, AltAssets can reveal.</p>
  <p>The firm is eyeing up to $600m for Gryphon Partners IV according to a set of filings made with the US Securities & Exchange Commission, as well as another $50m through a co-investment vehicle. Mid-market focused Gryphon pulled in $415m for its third buyout fund way back in 2006. The firm launched a fourth fund two years later, but quickly decided to defer it amid the trauma of the global financial crisis.</p>
  <p>It instead gathered $100m for a bridge vehicle in 2008, and is believed to have raised $365m for a second bridge fund in 2013. Gryphon hopes to hold a final close for the fund within the next 12 months, the filings suggest. Details of the new vehicle emerged amid Gryphon revealing it had agreed to sell its stake in environmental consulting company Trinity Consultants to fellow buyout house Levine Leichtman Capital Partners.</p>
  <p>Gryphon bought into the Dallas-based business in 2011 through an MBO. The firm, which celebrates its 20th anniversary this year, says it specialises in helping middle-market companies grow and become more competitive, in partnership with their management. It claims to generate “consistency of strong investment returns”, and to have accumulated some $1.4bn in cumulative equity commitments according to its website.</p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter3-article5"></a><h2>OMERS to tap Canada’s burgeoning tech sector with recently closed Fund II says exec</h2>
  <p class="text-info">Canada’s OMERS Ventures is looking to take advantage of the growing momentum in the country’s technology sector after closing its second fund on $260m, according to Jim Orlando.</p>
  <p>The new fund is significantly larger that its debut vehicle, OMERS Ventures Fund I, which closed on just above $200m and is fully invested and committed. OMERS managing director told AltAssets: “OMERS Ventures Fund I consisted of dollars exclusively from OMERS (Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System).</p>
  <p>“OMERS returned as a lead investor for Fund II, which provided us the opportunity to bring on both BMO Financial Group and Cisco Investments as valued co-investors. Fund II builds on the momentum of our Fund I, and the two together represent one of the largest long-term private capital pools active in Canada’s venture sector.“ OMERS Ventures is the venture capital investment arm of OMERS, one of Canada’s largest pension funds with $72bn in net assets.</p>
  <p>According to Orlando, Fund II is looking to invest into 10 to 15 companies, and will focus on the technology, media and telecommunications sectors in Canada and the US. He said, “There is a very strong base of talented and innovative tech entrepreneurs and companies in Canada, which is also drawing a lot of attention from our counterparts in the US. “With this momentum, there is an increase in the amount of capital available in the marketplace. Canadian companies that previously would have had to sell out can now go the distance to become independent leaders in their market segments.”</p>

  <p>“Create an open dialogue and ensure they’re informed with your plans to raise, and keep them apprised of your progress. Don’t wait until you’re already raising to forge those connections.” Earlier this year, OMERS agreed to acquire the Kenan Advantage Group from majority owners Goldman Sachs Capital Partners and Centerbridge Partners.</p>
  <p>In the same month, OMERS also purchased Environmental Resources Management from buyout house Charterhouse Capital Partners, in a deal worth $1.7bn rolled into the Fund VII pool.

  <p class="text-info">US-based private equity firm Sverica International has launched its fourth fund, six years after its predecessor, AltAssets can reveal. </p>
  <p>Sverica Capital Partners IV is targeting $250m according to a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The vehicle is yet to receive any commitments or list a placement agent. In April 2009, the Boston and San Francisco-based firm closed its third fund on $265m, above its initial target of $250m. Investors in the previous fund included foundations, university endowments, fund-of-funds, and high net worth individuals, although it is unclear whether Fund IV will follow the same make-up.</p>
  <p>The firm is focused on its three core industries, business and IT services, healthcare services and high value manufacturing, in the US and Canada according to its website. It also looks for opportunities in several sub-verticals including, educational services, outsourced services to the financial and legal sectors, pet care services, security and alarm monitoring and cyber security, among others.

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter3-article8"></a><h2>Andy Hunt, Jeremiah Daly leave Highland Capital to launch ‘Elephant Partners’</h2>
  <p class="text-info">Andy Hunt and Jeremiah Daly, who left Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Highland Capital Partners earlier this year to launch their own venture firm, are seeking $125m for their first fund, according to press reports.</p>
  <p>According to one of the reports, in a Wall Street Journal blog, Hunt and Daley are “looking to profit from the flood of capital washing over Silicon Valley”, and have set an ambitious target for their Elephant Partners fund, which is “more than triple the $40m million median amount raised by first-time US venture funds last year”.</p>
  <p>The WSJ blog said it got its information on the new fund from having viewed a presentation. According to this presentation, an unnamed “anchor investor” as well as unnamed Highland founders “have already committed over $50m” to Hunt and Daly’s fund. In addition to his background with Highland Capital, the “early thirty-something” Hunt, as the WSJ describes him, is also said to be a co-founder and director of eyeglass upstart Warby Parker, and current board member of Scopely.</p>
  <p>Daly joined HCP in 2012 – a year after Hunt – as a principal, after having spent three years with Accel Partners. Elephant Partners is said to be looking to emulate the success of another US venture capital newbie, Binary Capital, which last year raised $125m.  Like Hunt and Daly’s new business, it was also launched by two young investors: Jonathan Teo, formerly of Benchmark, and Justin Caldbeck, formerly of Bain Capital, the WSJ noted.</p>
  <p>It goes on to note that Elephant’s presentation “includes a chart that shows how startups can now raise big enough seed investments to ‘leapfrog’ firms such as Benchmark and Andreessen Horowitz that typically invest in Series A rounds”, a strategy that “could prove challenging, since nascent companies showing rapid growth are less likely to slip through the fingers of Silicon Valley’s top VCs”.</p>

  <p class="text-info">First Reserve infrastructure team managing director Chris Hearn is believed to have left the firm to launch his own energy investment business.</p>
  <p>Hearn has updated his LinkedIn page to show his seven years at First Reserve are at an end, and added a new listing for managing partner of Strata Energy Investments as his current job. His profile on the Strata website describes him as co-founder of the business, along with former GE Energy Financial Services managing director John Shepherd and ex-American Capital energy and infrastructure managing director Robert Wholey.</p>
  <p>Hearn joined First Reserve in 2008 as a co-founding partner of its energy infrastructure business. Before joining First Reserve, he was a managing director at Credit Suisse, where he had a 15-year career in the energy group and led the mergers and acquisitions team for the midstream and utility sectors in North America. Energy-focused First Reserve closed its second infrastructure fund on its $2.5bn hard cap last summer after just eight months in the fundraising market.</p>
  <p>That vehicle is more than twice the size of its 2009 predecessor, and brought its totals assets under management aimed at energy infrastructure to more than $4bn. Less successfully, the firm closed its flagship thirteenth fund on $3.4bn last October, way below its original $6bn target, a source confirmed to AltAssets at the time.</p>
  <p>The vehicle is smaller than Fund XII, which closed on $9bn in 2009 and also failed to reach its initial target of $12bn. Earlier this summer it hired Luke O’Keefe for a newly-created asset manager role in its energy infrastructure team. O’Keefe had most recently been vice president of technical risk at General Electric’s energy financial services business.</p>
