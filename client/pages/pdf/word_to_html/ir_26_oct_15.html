  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter1-article1"></a><h2>US venture fundraising balloon could be about to sag </h2>
  <p class="text-info">Strong annual results for US venture fundraising are masking a slide over the past few quarters, the latest research from Pitchbook shows.</p>
  <p>The data company’s Q4 US Venture Industry Report said that the $24.3bn of commitments closed through to the end of Q3 could hardly be called lacklustre, but added that Q3 itself might indicate the asset class is beginning to sputter. Less than $4bn was committed across 47 vehicles in the third quarter – the lowest numbers since the first half of 2013. Pitchbook said, “Whether or not that leaves 3Q as an outlier remains to be seen.</p>
  <p>“At first glance, the decline is most likely to be the result of timing. After all, from 2013 through the end of 2014, no fewer than 454 venture funds collected a massive total of $53.8bn. Adding that to the $24.3bn already raised through the end of September produces $78.1bn raised in the span of just over 2.5 years. Venture firms are no longer crowding the fundraising trail, having soaked up all the demand from LPs over the past few years.</p>
  <p>“LPs are now settling back and either waiting for their money to either still be put to work or come back so they can recommit. Again, the lack of liquidity is likely helping drive the diminution in fundraising.” The report said that “skyrocketing valuations” across the venture industry had not gone unnoticed by LPs, boosting enthusiasm for the asset class considerably. A record proportion of 87 per cent of US venture fundraisers have hit their targets in 2015 to date, it added.</p>
  <p>Pitchbook’s report added, “Hungry for returns in an era of low interest rates, LPs are hoping to board what could be an unprecedented wave of value creation in the tech & venture sectors. Even though 3Q numbers sagged heavily, the fact closing times for funds are still so low speaks to how eagerly LPs have been loosening the purse strings. The 3Q dip in fundraising could indicate a rising wariness, though. The typical venture fund usually underperforms its public market equivalent by vintage, as our Benchmarking & Fund Performance reports have shown.</p>
  <p>“We haven’t seen much discussion of a revision of venture fund structures ensuing, beyond suggestions to extend fund lifetimes at the outset, so LPs do seem by and large content with the status quo. “Perhaps they are right—what could be different in these most recent vintages is the sheer mass of microfunds. Committing to these funds entails much more risk but also the potential for much greater returns. A well-diversified microfund only needs a home run or two and a few singles—and in their case, a home run is in the range of the median exit values we saw previously.” </p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter1-article2"></a><h2>Private equity-backed US IPOs fall to lowest level for a decade</h2>
  <p class="text-info">Private equity-backed IPOs accounted for just under 36 per cent of all privately-backed US public offerings in the first nine months of 2015 – the lowest percentage in a decade.</p>
  <p>That data comes from research business Pitchbook’s latest US IPO Trends report, which highlighted the disparity with 2005, when PE accounted for 66 per cent of all IPOs. It said, “The drastic disparity speaks to the changing market dynamic nudging PE away from exiting assets through IPOs. As markets have improved in recent years, many PE portfolio companies have become ready for sale, proving ripe targets for growth-seeking corporations that had nursed themselves back to health as well.</p>
  <p>“Consequently, even over the last few years, corporate acquisitions have been more frequent than IPOs. A total of 32 PE-backed offerings have hit the market through September’s end, raising an aggregate $7.2bn according to the report. It said, “This number is anaemic relative to the same period in 2014, which saw $19.3bn raised across 50 listings. 2014 saw some of the strongest PE-sponsored IPO activity in the US of late, lifted by swelling total market valuations, and US public equities, which rose more than 11 per cent during the year.</p>
  <p>“This year, however, has seen shifts across the board. Valuations are still not cheap, although they have subsided a bit in the private sector. Public market volatility has rapidly increased throughout 2015, with US equities trading sideways, before experiencing a correction recently. Those factors combined with strategics’ eagerness to pay up for growth leaves an uncertain backdrop that provides little incentive for PE sponsors to undergo a complicated and expensive public offering. We saw this evidenced dramatically in 3Q – only $2bn was raised across 12 completed listings. The count was only off by two from 2Q, yet capital raised was down 51 per cent.” </p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter1-article3"></a><h2>Dunedin latest firm to join global mid-market PE group </h2>
  <p class="text-info">Mid-market UK private equity house Dunedin has joined a group of peers from the US and Western Europe in an initiative to share knowledge and help increase international portfolio company exits.</p>
  <p>The group, the Alliance for Global Growth (AGG), also includes firms such as Nordic-based Axcel, France’s Nixen, Spain’s Nazca and Brentwood Partners and Harris Preston Partners in the US. ACG said it intends to support growth within its members’ portfolios of companies during the investment period, and also to enhance opportunities for sale to international buyers at the point of exit. It added that shared knowledge and intelligence across the group would contribute to members’ deal origination and the identification of overseas investment opportunities. </p>
  <p>Three out of Dunedin’s last four exits were to international trade buyers. Dunedin managing partner Shaun Middleton said, “Globalisation is a continuing trend and local knowledge and relationships are a critically important factor in the internationalisation of any business. Joining this newly formed Alliance gives Dunedin and its portfolio companies the benefit of a global perspective.” </p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter1-article4"></a><h2>Smaller GPs struggling to attract LPs due to competition, says exec</h2>
  <p class="text-info">Smaller funds are facing increasing competition to land commitments from investors but can survive with a differentiated strategy according to Cebile Capital’s Sunaina Sinha.</p>
  <p>According to a report by the secondaries advisor and placement agent, competition for capital raised from investors has never been higher, with more than 2,200 funds seeking to raise an aggregate amount of $780bn. The report found that the average size of funds in the market is declining from $782m in 2013, to $543m in H1 2015. Cebile managing partner Sunaina Sinha told AltAssets, “It is undoubtedly harder to attract LP attention if you are raising a fund below $500m, unless you have top quartile performance.</p>
  <p>“There are dollars available for lower mid-market funds but the competition for these allocations is fierce. There are many more of these funds in the market than mega buyout funds. The fundraising environment has been favourable for general partners over the last two years, which explains the large number of funds on the market. However, that has increased competition for investors’ time and money. Many institutional investors still have the same size of team to evaluate these funds. That’s why it’s more important than ever to differentiate yourself early on in the process or funds risk getting lost in the noise.”</p>
  <p>The report, which is based on discussions with over 60 private equity funds fundraising data, explores challenges faced by mid-market funds, and what solutions are available to GPs looking to overcome them. Sinha added, “Competition is particularly fierce for GPs raising funds of less than $500m, with almost 80 per cent of US GPs currently fundraising looking to raise under $500m. Additionally, quite apart from competition, GPs raising less than $500m face unique challenges, as a result of their relatively smaller scale.”</p>
  <p>Sinha said that the size of the small funds precludes many potential LPs from being able to invest. In addition, the smaller funds have fewer resources at their disposal to commit to marketing activities and lower mid-market funds take longer to raise, on average, than larger ones.” Smaller fund managers must therefore be at the top of their fundraising game to prosper in the current environment. “However they (smaller funds) can survive in the market by having a differentiated strategy with a realised track record in the top quartile of their market.</p>
  <p>Suniha stresses the he importance of at least six months pre marketing and to focus on LPs in the home region but not to ignore those on other continents, as chances are that there may be less competition for a strategy in another region. Following the report, she added that it is important for the smaller funds hold a first close at a third of the fund target size and to the secondaries market via staple deals, restructuring or late primaries/early secondaries. “A track record with realisations is also essential to successful fundraising and ESG is important to some LPs and is becoming a popular diligence item for many others.” </p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter1-article5"></a><h2>GPs forced to innovate amid LP demands altering the PE landscape </h2>
  <p class="text-info">With LPs becoming more sophisticated and demanding the private equity industry is having to adapt and innovate to compete for investment, Adveq managing director and CEO Sven Liden says.</p>
  <p>The global industry has entered a “period of fundamental change that is re-shaping the way firms operate” according to a recent report by the London Business School’s Coller Institute of Private Equity, supported by Adveq. The report, The Shifting Business Model of Private Equity: Evolution, Revolution and Trench Warfare, was co-authored by Michael Jacobides (London Business School) and Jason Rico Saavedra (World Economic Forum).</p>
  <p>It found that factors such as increasing allocations from pension and sovereign wealth funds, and growing demand from institutional investors for specialist alpha generators, specifically activities that LPs cannot conduct themselves, are also going to reshape the private equity landscape. Liden told AltAssets, “Over the last few years, we have seen allocations to private equity increase considerable from an institutional investor perspective.</p>
  <p>“This is mainly due to the fact that private equity has, over the years, proved that it can overperform public markets in the mid and long-term. Institutional investors such as pension funds and sovereign wealth funds tend to have long investment horizons and so the illiquidity of private equity is not a big hurdle for them.”</p>
  <p>It added that some of the key changes that industry is likely to see include: greater collaboration and partnering between LPs, including mergers, in order to drive down investment costs, an increasing use of direct investments by LPs and changing investment terms. </p>
  <p>The report forecasts that many private equity firms will have to restructure their business models and approaches in response to changing demand. Liden said, “Investors have become more sophisticated and now demand that the firms that manage their money offer the returns and opportunities that they could not have added themselves. This has posed a clear challenge for asset managers to adapt and innovate in order to meet investors’ demands. </p>
  <p>Also clients require more and more customised exposure to private equity.” Liden agreed that firms need to adapt to offer more customised and specialised products to investors. “We (Adveq) have increased our offering with co-investments, secondaries exposure and the use of managed accounts. For example, all of our investors are now able to access co-investments within our primary investments as we have incorporated this strategy throughout our portfolio. </p>
  <p>It is important that firms who want to succeed focus on the client’s needs and fulfill them. The industry cannot continue offering the same products to everyone, it needs to innovate and adapt to what each investor needs.” The authors of the report also concluded that weaker fund-of-fund players will phase out, whereas stronger players with specialised offerings, strong track records and solid links to LPs will continue to play a strong role in the market.</p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter1-article6"></a><h2>LPs cautiously optimistic on India, exec says</h2>
  <p class="text-info">LPs are cautiously optimistic on India, despite seeing low levels of distributions form GPs, according to Cebile Capital’s Sunaina Sinha. </p>
  <p>The managing partner told AltAssets, “Indian private equity has been through the wringer over the last few years. “LPs, by in large, have been disappointed with the relatively low levels of distributions from GPs and realisations in their portfolios. In turn that lead to a number of LPs scaling back their India programs and as a result, a number of the poorer quality GPs have been unable to raise follow on funds according to Sinha. She added, “The Indian GPs who are able to raise their successive funds are usually best-in-class in their respective strategies.</p>
  <p>“The barrier to entry for LPs to invest in an Indian GP has never been higher and only the most exceptional GPs, with a track record of distributing capital back to LPs, make the cut.” Earlier this month, India-focused mid-market private equity firm Lighthouse Funds closed its second fund at $138m, just above the original $125m target. Cebile Capital acted as the exclusive global placement agent for the fund, which drew interest from existing investors as well as from new LPs, among which are the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC).</p>
  <p>Sinha said that the most important factor influencing LPs investment decisions continues to be track record with realisations and distributions. “Other factors include the longevity of the team, the institutional pedigree of the GP, differentiated strategy, value add to the portfolio, GP alignment and terms. GPs that focus on the domestic demand story in India continue to be most favoured by LPs. Strategies in which the supply-demand of capital favours the private equity investor, for example, in the lower mid-market and in the mid-market continue to garner favour.”</p>
  <p>Forum Synergies’ GP team recently told AltAssets that they are looking to take advantage of the renewed investor confidence in the country as it targets $150m for its second fund. General partner Sam Inamdar told AltAssets, “For proven, home grown fund managers such as Forum Synergies, the opportunity in India has significantly expanded.”</p>
  <p>Sinha agreed to an extent, “LPs continue to be cautiously optimistic on India. On the one hand, India is the only member of BRICS that is still going strong and the Indian domestic consumer base continues to exhibit strong growth. On the other hand, many Indian GPs have disappointed in terms of returns and realisations. Many LPs continue to monitor the Indian private equity landscape closely and choose to invest in top decile managers in their strategies.” information.”</p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter1-article7"></a><h2>China still has infra potential despite ‘media sensation’ over country’s problems</h2>
  <p class="text-info">China has potential to be an exciting hub of new infrastructure opportunities despite “media sensation” that the country is in a “horrible state”, IFC Emerging Asia Fund co-head Andrew Yee has told AltAssets.</p>
  <p>Yee, who took on the role co-heading the unit in December last year, said that despite state-owned enterprises in the country muscling out private capital in certain sectors, certain areas are still attractive for PE dealmaking. He said, “I think it is media sensation to say that China is in a horrible state. If you look at China over the last five, 10, 15, 25 years, it has been one of the economic miracles of the world and that is the whole world and not just emerging markets. “My point is that China still has got a lot of potential for infrastructure.</p>
  <p>“It is substantially de-risked. It is very quickly becoming effectively a developed market. Most of the big cities are now developed market infrastructure-wise. But obviously there is a bunch of smaller cities in the countryside where there needs to be a lot more spent. Now the issue for China is that there is now a whole bunch of state-owned enterprises. Five or ten in each sector, whether it be roads, airports, power, distribution of gas which now dominate and are prepared to invest in projects if they offer, say an 8 to 10 per cent return.</p>
  <p>“Now, this leaves not much room for private capital in infrastructure. “There are opportunities in certain areas, like waste, water which are sort of newer, upcoming areas where China has to deal with its environmental issues.” A PricewaterhouseCoopers outlook for capital project and infrastructure spending till 2025 says that spending on utility infrastructure will be especially strong in countries that need to upgrade deficient energy, water, and sanitation services and in economies that are rapidly urbanising, such as China, India, the Philippines, Indonesia, Ghana, and Nigeria.</p>
  <p>Yee said that there were many high-returning opportunities for private equity in Asia targeting equity cheques of up to $150m, which could generate 15 to 20 per cent returns or higher. He cited potentially greater IRRs from India, Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam in water investments, for example. “It is all about risk-adjusted returns,” he said. “Anyone can say ‘we are targeting 15 per cent or 20 per cent IRR’, but if the risk in that country is huge, what percentage do you subtract from that 15-20 per cent to make it comparable to another more developed country?</p>
  <p>“So, for example 15 per cent in China might be 10 per cent in the US or Europe. But similarly, it would be 20 per cent in the Philippines and maybe 25 per cent in Vietnam. After you adjust for risk, however, they are probably all about the same. If you are a pension fund you would act more defensive and go to the US, but if you are a hedge fund for example and you are prepared to lose a bit of money you could invest in Vietnam.</p>
  <p>“Maybe you will lose one investment but make higher returns on three others.” Yee cited size as a determining factor when evaluating opportunities to get higher returns on infrastructure investments in emerging markets. He said that although a risk-adjustment could show that some emerging markets would deliver better returns than developed ones, it is also a matter of size. Yee said, “I am not saying emerging markets offer better risk-adjusted returns than developed markets or vice versa.</p>
  <p>“It really depends on the size of investor you are and whether you are looking for alpha or not. Some of the pension funds and insurance companies are very happy if they get 7-8 per cent net return. “Their goal is to grow a few per cent a year and cover their liabilities. So, they can invest in a bond or effectively an infrastructure project in the US which generates 9 or 10 per cent and after seeds comes to 7 or 8 per cent net. However, if you are a big sovereign wealth fund and you have got $500bn, there is no point growing at 2 to 3 per cent.</p>
  <p>“Such funds want to be more aggressive and generate 10 per cent a year. Look at GIC or ADIA, they do that – they take some safe bets but they take some risky ones too. It is just a calculated risk. They might have $100m or $100bn to invest in infrastructure and some of them will leave 20-30 per cent to put in emerging markets. And of that investment produces 3x return and 25 per cent IRR, that would pull the overall portfolio return from 10 to 12-13 per cent. My point is, emerging markets are not for everyone but for somebody looking for slightly higher returns and better diversification. And then it makes sense to work with somebody who has got the skills like the IFC World Bank, a very safe government organisation.”</p>
  <p>Commenting about infrastructure opportunities in Africa, Yee said, “The power sector has been a big one in Africa for a long time and South Africa is the only country which has achieved real progress in this sector so far. There has been a huge amount of growth in this industry and there will be more M&A in due course and that includes renewable, although it would be predominantly gas and coal-fired that builds true capacity in the next few years. South Africa is maybe the only Sub-Saharan country at any stage of development, so the rest are in really early stages.</p>
  <p>“There are significant opportunities for those who do it right, so it is a double-edged sword. South Africa is the only sizeable developed country in Africa that has got its power. It still needs a lot more but at least it has got a head start on putting enough power generation capacity. The rest have huge amount of work to do.” Yee gave an example with Nigeria, “a very rich, large, successful African country with growing population”, which however “has to deal with serious governance issues” that have set it back in the past.</p>
  <p>“[Nigeria’s government] has done a lot to sell off and privatise various old assets and start some new projects in the last five years but it is just not getting built. But Nigeria is one of the most interesting African markets and it is no wonder that there is a huge amount of private capital looking at Nigerian opportunities. But very few of them have made much money and quite a lot of people have lost a lot because things just do not happen. Nigeria is one of the great targets but has not delivered on its potential.”</p>
  <p>Sub-Saharan Africa will be the region to see the greatest growth rate for utilities spending over the next ten years, according to the PwC report. Overall, Nigeria and South Africa dominate the capital project and infrastructure market in the region, the report says. Nigeria’s share is expected to grow substantially over the next decade because of better government finances and the fastest rate of urbanisation on the continent. In general, infrastructure spending in Sub-Saharan Africa will grow on average 10 per cent a year in the next ten years, exceeding $180bn by 2025, PwC projects. </p>


  <h1>LP News</h1>
  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter2-article1"></a><h2>LP Profile: Vijoy Chattergy, State of Hawaii Employees’ Retirement System</h2>
  <p class="text-info">With $14bn in assets under management, the State of Hawaii Employees’ Retirement System (ERS) is the state-wide plan for all public services in Hawaii, including firefighters, teachers, lifeguards, judges and politicians.</p>
  <p>The pension plan, which started investing in private equity in 1999, is going through a period of ongoing development and change, according to chief investment officer Vijoy Chattergy. “One of the big changes in the last year or so – and this has been an ongoing effort since the financial crisis – was to better diversify the risk in the portfolio,” he says. “We made initial changes in terms of the structure of the portfolio, we added global tips, we added covered calls and we made a commitment to increase private equity from about 3.5 per cent of the portfolio to around seven per cent.”</p>
  <p>ERS plans to make private equity one component of the private markets allocation. “What we find with private markets is there are opportunities to realise excess return, there are opportunities to develop strong dedicated relationships with GPs, and hopefully, in time, to also get opportunities and exposure to off-market transactions and investments,” Chattergy said.</p>
  <p>For the first 12-13 years the plan used a fund-of-one structure with an unnamed private equity firm as its manager. ERS then hired Hamilton Lane to take over the legacy portfolio and build a new concentrated and targeted private equity portfolio, with larger bite sizes – a reflection of a more concentrated number of managers and a doubling of its exposure to private equity.</p>
  <p>The fund’s allocation to venture capital is coming down, but only because the rest of the portfolio is growing. The fund will maintain exposure to strong-performing VC managers that fit within the context of the broader PE portfolio. “We decided we had to right size and optimise the portfolio in some way, so that one third of the allocation to venture is going to come down eventually and will be closer to 20 per cent,” says Chattergy. “We want to become more selective because of the traditional overweight we have had in the venture space.”</p>
  <p>In October 2014, ERS adopted policy language to create a portfolio based on functional risk classes. So, as opposed to traditional asset ratings, it now allocates according to growth risk, principal protection, real return and real estate. “In an effort to move more completely to these functional risk classes, we are considering breaking out the real estate component into non-core and core,” he says.</p>
  <p>“Real estate has traditionally been about a seven per cent allocation – in the past it has been around nine per cent, but we brought it down after the financial crisis. Around that time we also hired Courtland Partners to be our real estate consultant. They have built a portfolio with us that is 70 per cent core real estate, 20 per cent value added and ten per cent opportunistic. So instead of having a real estate allocation of seven per cent, we will allocate our core real estate in something we call stabilised growth, and next to that we have non-core, value-add and opportunistic, in the private space sitting next to private equity.”</p>
  <p>ERS is and has been primarily focused on the US. However, Chattergy admits it is currently taking steps to better diversify the geographic structure of the private market portfolio, and with the help of Hamilton Lane, it has already begun to invest in Europe. “We have had some great managers for a long time thanks to our prior private equity manager, like CVC Capital Partners, which has given us exposure to Europe and elsewhere, but we would like to find more dedicated opportunities on the real estate side. We did invest in our first single country fund, Fortress Japan, a couple of years ago, and we would like to do more of that and find some pan-Asia type approaches.”</p>
  <p>Along with an interest in Europe and Asia, Chattergy admits that ERS is also eyeing opportunities in emerging markets, having already structured a secondary investment in the Abraaj Fund. Public fund, public pressure Earlier this year, the Institutional Limited Partners Association, which represents more than 300 pension funds and other private equity fund investors globally, announced plans to implement more robust and consistent standards for fee and expense reporting.</p>
  <p>The move, dubbed the Fee Transparency Initiative, followed a summer of revelations over the lack of transparency on fees. CalPERS was unable to disclose the amount it had paid for private equity over an 18-year-period, while PGGM, the Dutch pension fund giant, said it would “stop investing in outside money managers, including private-equity firms, that don’t fully disclose their fees”. Chattergy says that when it comes to the ideal fee structure he can only comment in the context of a specific manager and strategy.</p>
  <p>“It might be on a case-by-case basis, dependent on the opportunity and the skill of the manager, but it’s probably lower than what it is now. Also, in terms of alignment, I think we want to be aligned in terms of the portfolio, and even products, if we invest in multiple products with the manager. “We would like to see an alignment of fee structure across those products, so if we are going to be a good LP and invest in multiple vintages and multiple strategies, we would like to develop a more holistic relationship with that GP.”</p>
  <p>Whether it’s the US, Europe or Asia, Chattergy has no doubts over ERS’s criteria for the aforementioned GP. “We want to invest with GPs that have proven track records, great teams and are in a great space that fits into our overall portfolio. We are always looking for those opportunities and we would like to become more global in terms of our footprint. So we look for relationship pricing in terms of fees to better align interests, we look for market intelligence, exchange or sharing so we can think of our GPs as an extension of our research efforts, and we are also looking to GPs who are willing to provide some level of training to staff and trustees.”</p>
  <p>Chattergy said one of the main challenges for an LP is being able to explain the asset class and its governance structure to stakeholders so they understand the opportunity. However he openly admits the biggest challenge facing an LP over the past few years has been getting transparency in the GPs, despite seeing improvements.</p>
  <p>“LPs are demanding more transparency and GPs are responsive to that, as they need to be. The regulatory scrutiny is something that is fairly new, but that is probably leading to some level of increased transparency,” he says. “I think there is a lot of interest in the asset class, more so than in the past, by institutional investors who are going to need that level of comfort to make investments. Those are all positive trends which are leading to an increased level of transparency in the market.”</p>
