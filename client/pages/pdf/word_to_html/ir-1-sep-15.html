  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter1-article1"></a><h2>PE activity in US retail & consumer remains strong despite wider sector M&A slowdown</h2>
  <p class="text-info">Private equity activity in the US retail and consumer sector remained strong in the second quarter despite an overall slowdown in M&A activity in the segment, new research suggests.</p>
  <p>Buyout firms remained active in the sector in cash optimisation investment opportunities, as well as using capital to fuel expanded growth that included adding store locations, extending brands into other product categories and into new geographic markets, often overseas, PwC US said. Private equity volume as a percentage of total deal volume was 26 per cent, up from 24 per cent in the first quarter of 2015 and up from 25 per cent in the second quarter of 2014.</p>
  <p>PE value as a percentage of total deal value on the other hand was 20 per cent, down from 69 per cent in the first quarter of 2015 and up from 15 per cent in the second quarter of 2014. Overall the US retail and consumer sector experienced a slower second quarter which was largely driven by four megadeals, with a value of over $1bn. PwC said 31 deals with values over $50m were announced for the quarter, down 24 per cent from the first quarter of this year and down 42 per cent from the second quarter of 2014.</p>
  <p>Total transaction value for the second quarter of 2015, $27.3bn, was down 66 per cent from $79bn in the first quarter of 2015. The first quarter, however, included the largest mega deal seen in the sector for several years – the $53.1bn Heinz / Kraft merger. PwC said that in a sign of convergence among the retail and health industries, two of the megadeals in the second quarter were from CVS Health, which agreed to acquire Omnicare for $12.7bn and also the pharmacy and clinic businesses of Target Corp for $1.9bn.</p>
  <p>PwC US retail and consumer deals leader Leanne Sardiga said, “While consumer sentiment ended on a high note during the second quarter, mixed economic activity resulted in sluggish retail sales growth and fewer retail and consumer deals. We believe that during the second half of the year, retail & consumer companies will continue to reposition themselves around the megatrends and increasingly engage in deals for three reasons: to drive growth, reposition their businesses, and better compete within the sector.”</p>
  <p>IPO activity in the retail and consumer sector outpaced the prior three quarters in both volume and value, with eight IPOs accumulating $1.7bn. Cross border activity decreased on a year-over-year basis and represented 32 per cent of deal volume during the quarter, lower than the average of 47 per cent over the past eight quarters. Despite the continued slowdown, PwC said it expected cross border activity to continue as domestic R&C companies remain attractive to faster-growing international markets.</p>
  <p>Sardiga said, “The IPO market in the second quarter continued the trend from 2014, with R&C as the sector with the highest returns in the overall IPO markets. Private equity participants remained focused on transactions in the food and beverage retailing sub-sectors. And with cross border activity, strong U.S. brands and the large consumer market still remain attractive to multinational buyers.” Private equity activity in the US retail and consumer sector remained strong in the second quarter despite an overall slowdown in M&A activity in the segment, new research suggests.</p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter1-article2"></a><h2>Trump latest US presidential candidate to target ‘carried interest loophole’</h2>
  <p class="text-info">Donald Trump, the New York real estate tycoon who is the Republican party’s leading candidate for president, has attacked hedge fund managers as “paper pushers” who are  “getting away with murder” by not paying their fair share of taxes.</p>
  <p>His remarks were seen as referring in part to the so-called “carried interest loophole”, which allows US hedge fund managers as well as other types of alternative asset managers to pay tax at a lower capital gains rate, of 20 per cent, than they would pay if their gains were classified as ordinary income. In a telephone interview on an American news show Face the Nation on Sunday night, Trump vowed to reform the tax laws to eliminate such loopholes if he is elected.</p>
  <p>“The hedge fund guys didn’t build this country. These are guys that shift paper around and they get lucky,” Trump said. In targeting the carried interest loophole, Trump aligned himself with the front-runner of the opposing Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton. During her campaign, she has repeatedly called for reforms to the carried interest tax structure, saying it was wrong that hedge fund managers “pay lower taxes than nurses”.</p>
  <p>In going after the alternative asset management sector, Trump risks alienating many fellow Republicans, as it tends to be the party supported by wealthy Americans. Earlier in the campaign, Trump attacked America’s policy on immigration and in particular, its handling of illegal immigrants, some 11 million of whom are estimated to live in the US.</p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter1-article3"></a><h2>Secondary players increasingly wary of currency risks says exec</h2>
  <p class="text-info">Secondary funds have started to hedge against currency risks according to Gregg Kantor of Investec. </p>
  <p>He told AltAssets, “One of the things we have been looking at a lot is hedging and how secondary funds are hedging their currencies. “Typically secondary houses haven’t been focused on hedging their portfolios, taking the view that, investors will hedge at their level and having some assets in dollars and some in euros will over time balance out. I think that’s changed and people have had to reconsider the risks of the currencies moving and that request has started to filter through.”</p>
  <p>Earlier this week the Chinese stock market plunged after concerns over the country’s slowing growth which triggered a global sell-off. The Shanghai Composite, China’s main stock exchange, fell 7.6 per cent on what state media have dubbed China’s “Black Monday”. As a result it was the worst fall since 2007 and caused sharp drops in markets in the US and Europe, demonstrating the volatility and risks associated by with currencies.</p>
  <p>“If you are in the US with a dollar-dominator fund and own European assets you will have seen quite a big downturn in the value of those Euro assets relative to the dollar-dominated fund. We have seen a lot of US funds who have looked to hedge and lock in the value of the Euro today rather than taking the risk of letting it drop even further, ” according to Kantor. He added that over the past few years secondaries has become more acceptable to people. The market has now evolved from the ‘last chance saloon’ for people who were desperate for liquidity and were willing to take losses on their portfolio in order to get cash there and then.</p>
  <p>“To begin with, selling on the secondary market was a little bit of a dirty word, it wasn’t a very accepted route to go down. As the secondary market has grown and evolved, in buyout at least, it has become part and parcel for all investors.” Kantor also notes that with the evolution there is also an increase interest in real estate secondaries and venture capital secondaries. He said, “We have certainly seen an increase in the number of people looking to purchase property portfolios, both on the direct and secondary side. </p>
  <p>“If you look at the secondary market overall it’s a great area for people to be into. The maturation of the market has also led to an evolution of the makeup of sellers. The first sellers were the banks, who were driven mainly by regulation and capital costs. At the end of the last year and the beginning of this year, Pension funds were the big sellers”, according to Kantor, again driven by portfolio management requirements.</p>
  <p>“We have seen a concentration into certain managers that, for one reason or another, pension plans have decided are mangers they would like to back, and that has been a driver for active portfolio management. More recently where we have spoken to potential sellers it has actually been secondary houses and fund of funds themselves who are looking to take advantage of what is essentially a sellers’ market to tidy up some of the loose ends of their tail end portfolios. They are seeing the market as a good opportunity to go and exit those late stage positions.”</p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter1-article4"></a><h2>Alternative funds biz growing in Jersey: PE now 20% of total funds AUM</h2>
  <p class="text-info">The global growth in the popularity of alternative asset classes is being reflected in the composition of funds administered in Jersey, the UK Crown Dependency, where private equity funds alone now account for around one fifth of total regulated fund assets under management.</p>
  <p>At the end of June, private equity funds administered on the island stood at approximately £44bn, up around 2 per cent from the same point a year earlier, and roughly 20 per cent of the total funds AUM of £218bn, according to the latest data from the Jersey Financial Services Commission (JFSC). That total AUM figure, of £218bn – representing the net asset value of all regulated funds under administration in Jersey – is around 9 per cent higher than it stood at the end of June 2014, the JFSC data shows.</p>
  <p>Jersey has been taking advantage of the fact that it is able to market its funds into Europe through national private placement regimes (NPPRs) under the EU Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD). Since the regulation was implemented last year, island fund administrators have been making use of the private placement system, and have now registered some 205 such private placement-regime funds, according to the JFSC.</p>
  <p>Other key points contained in the JFSC data: Eighty-four fund managers have now received private placement authorisation in Jersey, up 40 per cent over the previous six months. In the year to the end of June, the total net asset value of alternative assets administered in Jersey rose 15 per cent, compared with the same point a year earlier. On average, a new fund was launched in Jersey every week during the first six months of 2015</p>
  <p>During the year to the end of June, assets under management in the alternative asset class category as a whole grew by 15 per cent. In addition to the 2 per cent rise already referred to in the private equity category, Jersey hedge funds posted a 31 per cent rise in AUM, while the islands’ real estate funds saw AUM grow by 16 per cent. Jersey funds industry experts say the ability of island fund managers to take advantage of the national private placement regimes system to market into Europe is expected to remain in place until 2018 at least.</p>
  <p>And they are optimistic that it will be extended, pointing to the fact that the European Securities and Markets Authority said in July that it planned to recommend Jersey be included in a ‘first wave of third non-EU countries’ whose managers could seek authorisation for a passport to market their alternative investment funds to professional investors throughout EU member states.</p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter1-article5"></a><h2>Despite the risks Infrastructure is still very attractive for investors says exec</h2>
  <p class="text-info">Despite the number of risks associated with investing in infrastructure, Cube Infrastructure CEO and managing partner Renuad De Matharel says the returns still remain attractive.</p>
  <p>He told AltAssets, “Infrastructure investment was seen as a bond-like market when it started in the mid-90s, so investors were investing thinking they were going to get a very stable, predictable returns that would be comparable to those of a bond. Investors have now become aware that infrastructure is a private equity market that has its own series of risks that need to be carefully monitored in order to have proper performance on investment.”</p>
  <p>Cube Infrastructure focuses predominately on brownfield infrastructure and public sector assets, preferably in the mid-market with investments ranging from €50m to €150m. Along with the key issue of operational risk, “Another key risk that has revealed itself over the last five to ten years is the so-called change in law risk or political risk.</p>
  <p>“This risk occurs often after the private sector has built and operated for some time an infrastructure asset and the public sector finds itself under pressure about the cost of it and seeks to change the legal environment or re-negotiate the terms of the P3 / concession contract with the private sector because of that.”</p>
  <p>An example of this of when the Spanish government called for a very strong investment in wind and solar energy between 1990 and 2010.  As the investments were completed and the assets were up and running, the government then decided to scrap the subsidies on all existing contracts and imposed on top of that additional taxes. There are other risks which would further characterise infrastructure investment as a private equity business rather than as a bond like investment according to De Matharel.</p>
  <p>“The most common ones are obviously volume and demand risks (often linked to GDP), the adequacy of tariff formulas to cover actual infrastructure operating costs, cross currency risk, etc.  No real mystery about these risks which are PE look-alike by nature.” He also added as with private equity, putting too much debt on an investment increases the risk of total loss on an equity investment when a risk materialises.</p>
  <p>“The presence of these risks should not refrain investors from investing in our business, which remains very attractive in many aspects to meet the risk-return profile they are seeking. In particular, the long term profile of P3 and concession contracts gives significant visibility on revenues and future cash flows and hence on recurring dividend payments. These recurring dividend payments constitute an attractive substitute to bonds for pension funds and insurance groups that are facing longer payment obligations to their aging clients in a very low bond yield environment.”</p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter2-article1"></a><h2>Limited partners trade group to boost ‘activities’ in DC</h2>
  <p class="text-info">The Institutional Limited Partners Association, which represents more than 300 pension funds and other private equity fund investors globally, is planning to increase its activities on behalf of the industry in Washington, DC, AltAssets understands.</p>
  <p>However, the Toronto-based organisation is also understood to be playing down the geographical significance of the appointment, in June, of a Washington-based individual, Peter Freire, as executive director. The matter of a possible “push” aimed at raising the ILPA’s profile in Washington, involving a “shift” of leadership to that city from Toronto, was first raised by an article earlier this week carried by Private Equity News, a Dow Jones publication. The article noted that the ILPA’s planned move came “as the industry faces scrutiny over transparency”. The ILPA declined to comment on the matter on Wednesday.</p>
  <p>But a source close to the organisation, who didn’t want to be identified, said the ILPA’s plans to increase its Washington “activities” were being made in response to an expressed desire on the part of its members for it to do so – and not in reaction to, for example, recent criticism of the carried interest element of the private equity payment structure, or recent publicity over the transparency of private equity fees.</p>
  <p>Questions about a possible greater emphasis being placed on Washington by the ILPA are thought to have been prompted by the appointment of Freire to succeed Kathy Jeramaz Larson, who ended her eight years heading up the organisation at the end of June.  Jeramaz Larson had been based in Toronto. Freire had been based in Washington in his previous job, with the World Economic Forum.</p>
  <p>Also based in ILPA’s Washington office since she was hired by the organisation in 2014 is the group’s head of industry affairs, Jennifer Choi. But according to Private Equity News, it has just three employees in Washington, one in Boston, and 12 in Toronto. The organisation has not indicated it has any plans to change these numbers. Of the ILPA’s approximately 300 member entities, 64 per cent are based in the US, 15 per cent are based in Europe, and 10 per cent are based in Canada.</p>
  <p>As AltAssets has been reporting in recent weeks, private equity firms have been increasingly coming under the spotlight for what critics have said is a lack of transparency with respect to the way client investors – including the pension funds of thousands of government employees – are charged for the management of their assets.</p>
  <p>The matter of carried interest, which such US presidential candidates as Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have been mentioning in their recent campaign speeches, is a separate topic, but not, some private equity veterans point out, a new one.  At least one other US presidential candidate, Mitt Romney, brought it up previously – in his case, during the 2012 presidential campaign.</p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter2-article2"></a><h2>TIAA-CREF in tie-up with 2 Swedish pension funds to buy European property</h2>
  <p class="text-info">TIAA-CREF, the $869bn US pension entity, is joining forces with two of Sweden’s national pension funds to create a €4bn-plus pan-European office investment platform.</p>
  <p>The new joint venture will be seeded with 15 properties already owned by the TIAA General Account and the two Swedish funds – AP1 and AP2 – which are worth a combined total of around €2.2bn, TIAA-CREF said in a statement issued out of New York on Wednesday. In addition, the venture will also commence “an active investment programme, with new capital from the TIAA General Account, AP1 and AP2, targeting an additional €2bn of investment over the next three years,” the TIAA-CREF statement said.</p>
  <p>The investment programme will primarily target ‘core’ investments in so-called Tier 1 cities, such as London, Paris, Munich, Hamburg, Frankfurt and Berlin, according to TIAA-CREF. Additionally, “the investment programme will invest in ‘value-add’ opportunities such as leasing, renovation and development opportunities in Tier 1 cites, or stabilised core investments within Tier 2 cities that include Madrid, Milan and Amsterdam, among others”, the statement went on. </p>
  <p>The deal is expected to close in September. The new investment vehicle, which is being called Cityhold Office Partnership, will be managed by TH Real Estate, an overseas property investment entity TIAA-CREF launched in 2014 and took full ownership of this year. It currently has $86bn worth of real estate assets under management, according to TIAA-CREF. TIAA-CREF will hold a 50 per cent interest in Cityhold, while each AP fund will hold a 25 per cent stake.</p>
  <p>Of the 15 seed property assets, nine are coming from the TIAA General Account and six from the Swedish funds, the TIAA-CREF statement said. They total 2.7m sq ft worth of property, and include such landmark buildings as 12-14 New Fetter Lane, and One Kingdom Street, in London; Tour Areva in Paris; and Atlantic Haus in Hamburg. TIAA-CREF’s affiliate, TH Real Estate, brought the parties together and will manage the vehicle on the investors’ behalf, providing investment and asset management services.</p>
  <p>The AP1 and AP2 pension funds each has around 300bn Swedish Krona (around $36bn, or €31.4bn) worth of assets under management. Phil McAndrews, chief investment officer of TIAA-CREF Global Real Estate, said the tie-up with the Swedish pension funds would enable TIAA-CREF to “further diversify [our] existing European office portfolio across asset, tenant and market exposures, while establishing a broader platform to expand our European investments”.</p>
  <p>In its statement, TIAA-CREF noted that real estate have been a key part of its investment portfolio since 1934, and at the end of June accounted for around $86bn in assets under management. TIAA-CREF’s global real estate platform includes TH Real Estate’s $28 billion in assets under management across 50 funds and mandates, TIAA-CREF said.</p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter2-article3"></a><h2>Five new investors take stakes in Palamon Capital entities</h2>
  <p class="text-info">Palamon Capital Partners, a pan-European private equity firm, said five “top-tier” investors have purchased stakes in its funds from existing LPs, and are committing capital to a new vehicle that will invest alongside its Palamon Auxiliary Partnership 2013 fund.</p>
  <p>The participating investors are Adams Street Partners, Goldman Sachs AIMS Private Equity Group, Morgan Stanley Alternative Investment Partners, the Dutch pension fund service provider PGGM, and the Rothschild Merchant Banking Group.</p>
  <p>The arrangement comes after Palamon’s announcement earlier this year that it had mandated Credit Suisse Asset Management, acting through Credit Suisse Private Funds Group, to organise a whole-fund liquidity option for those of its LPs interested in selling their interests in two Palamon limited partnership arrangements.</p>
  <p>Subsequently an offer book was built for the entirety of the interests in both funds, following a competitive auction process overseen by Credit Suisse, resulting in the just-announced transactions. More than one-quarter of the aggregate NAV was exchanged, with the structure and terms of Palamon I and II remaining unchanged following the sales, London-based Palamon said.</p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter2-article4"></a><h2>Thames Tideway Tunnel receives £1.2bn-plus in backing from UK investors</h2>
  <p class="text-info">A consortium of international pension and sovereign wealth funds – including an arm of the Kuwait Investment Authority, Hermes, and the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan – is reported to be preparing to pay a total of £2bn for a stake in London’s City Airport.</p>
  <p>Thus far none of the companies reported to be involved have formally commented on the report, which thus far has appeared in such London media outlets as the Daily Telegraph and Evening Standard, except to say that they don’t comment on market speculation. A spokeswoman for OTPP said it was “not commenting”. London City Airport is smaller than London’s other, more globally-focused airports, Gatwick and Heathrow, and favoured by many of those working in London’s financial district and Docklands area, because it is easy to get to and from, and in and out of. </p>
  <p>The scramble to bid for it was kicked off earlier this month after its US owner, Global Infrastructure Partners, said it was considering selling its 75 per cent stake. Global Infrastructure Partners is a New York-based infrastructure entity, with around $15.4bn in assets under management, according to its website. It first invested in the airport in 2006.</p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter2-article5"></a><h2>Scottish Investment Bank plans £75m of co-investment through new structure</h2>
  <p class="text-info">The Scottish Investment Bank plans to invest up to £75m in Scottish companies over the next three years after relaunching its co-investment funds.</p>
  <p>SIB has streamlined its funds by reducing them from four vehicles to just two – the Scottish Co-Investment Fund and Scottish Venture Fund. Both vehicles are also widening their deal parameters, with investments ranging from just £10,000 to £1.5m through the SCF, and up to £2m through the SVF, in deals sizes of up to £10m. Investment through the SCF is alongside ‘accredited partners’ who are experienced investors, vetted by SIB.</p>
  <p>Following successful accreditation, the investment partner can lead multiple investment deals alongside SIB, with fast track access to matched funding across a wide investment range into eligible deals. While still led by private sector investors, investment through the SVF does not require an accredited partner. Kerry Sharp, Head of the Scottish Investment Bank, said: “We’ve been monitoring the market and listening to our investors, and the message was clear that companies increasingly need funding to be more flexible than ever before.</p>
  <p>“That’s why we’ve widened the investment parameters and simplified the criteria to benefit both the private sector investors we work with and the companies we invest in. This greater flexibility to invest across a broader range of businesses will enable us to support more companies to reach their full potential, which in turn helps the Scottish economy to grow.” This time last year the firm hired another three people to expand its private equity infrastructure team. Former Rothschild investment banker Babaola Omiyale joined as an investment manager, Lewis Haffey as an investment analyst and Aaron Donoghue as an engineering and project operations consultant.</p>

  <p class="text-info">US growth equity veteran Summit Partners has confirmed plans to raise up to $3.6bn across two new vehicles, AltAssets can reveal.</p>
  <p>Summit is seeking up to $3bn for its ninth flagship growth capital fund according to new filings made with the US securities regulator. The firm is also targeting up to $600m for a fourth Venture Capital vehicle, although no capital has been registered towards either fund to date.</p>
  <p>Summit pulled in more than $3.2bn across its predecessor vehicles in the two segments in 2012, raising $2.7bn for Growth Equity Fund VIII and $520m for Venture Capital Fund III. The larger of those vehicles was raised to target equity investments of more than $45m, with the venture capital fund focused on investments below that size. Summit was launched back in 1984, and is currently investing more than $6.5bn into equity and fixed income opportunities according to its website.</p>

  <p class="text-info">US-based Oak Hill Capital Partners has launched its fourth flagship fund with a $3bn target, AltAssets can reveal.</p>
  <p>Oak Hill Capital Partners IV is yet to receive any commitments according to a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The filing does however list Lazard Freres & Co and Lazard & Co as placement agents, with sales commission priced at $12.6m. If the new fund reaches its target it will still be significantly smaller than its predecessor, Oak Hill Capital Partners III, which closed on $3.8bn in 2009 with a $350m GP commitment.</p>
  <p>Oak Hill Capital Partners manages private equity funds with more than $8bn of initial capital commitments. In February, AltAssets reported that Oak Hill had bolstered its team ahead of the fundraise, with the hire of investment veteran Steven Puccinelli as partner.</p>

  <p class="text-info">Dallas-based private equity firm Edge Natural Resources has closed its debut fund on $445.7m.</p>
  <p>The fund, ENR Partners, will look at opportunities in the small-cap North American upstream and oilfield services sectors. It is not clear at this stage where the commitments came from, however Edge did not use a placement agent in connection with the formation of the fund. Partner Jesse Bomer said, “We are extremely grateful for the confidence our investors showed in our team and strategy.</p>
  <p>“This support allowed us to quickly conclude the fundraising process with demand far exceeding our self-imposed hard cap on commitments. Most importantly, we have patient capital from a diverse, energy-savvy investor base.” Edge makes $20 to $75m control-oriented equity investments in partnership with best-in-class management teams that have an edge in their particular area of focus, according to ENR’s website.</p>
  <p>The firm is led by four partners, Roy Aneed, Jesse Bomer, Oscar Pate and Stacie Moore. In July, Ridgewood Energy, a private upstream oil and gas investment company, closed its latest private equity fund on more than $1.9bn, putting it well ahead of its $1.5bn target.</p>

  <p class="text-info">Washington-based Accolade Partners looks to have closed its fifth fund of funds on its $200m target, making it the firm’s largest fund to date.</p>
  <p>The firm pulled in the capital from 143 LPs according to a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Accolade Partner V launched in September last year, 12 months after holding a final close for its predecessor vehicle. In 2013, AltAssets reported that Accolade had closed its fourth fund of funds on $150m after 16 months on the road. That vehicle was nearly 50 per cent larger than the firm’s third fund of funds, which raised $105m in 2008.</p>
  <p>Accolade were unavailable to respond to a request for comment. The firm invests in venture capital and growth equity firms focused on technology and healthcare according to its website.

  <p class="text-info">US early stage investment firm Vertex Ventures has pulled in more than $140m for its debut fund thanks to Singapore sovereign investor Temasek anchoring the vehicle.</p>
  <p>The firm - which is unrelated to Temasek’s Vertex Venture Holdings arm - previously registered $107.5m in January. Palo Alto-based Vertex is led by general partners In Sik Rhee and Jonathan Heiliger. Rhee was previously a managing partner at Rembrandt Venture Partners and venture partner at Accel Partners, while Heiliger was a general partner at North Bridge Venture Partners, and VP of infrastructure and technical operations at Facebook between 2007 and 2011.</p>

  <p class="text-info">US-based venture capital firm Owl Ventures has closed a $100m fund to target the education tech sector, AltAssets can reveal.</p>
  <p>Owl was co-founded by Tory Patterson and Jed Smith, who previously ran consumer goods and tech fund Catamount Ventures. As a result, all the active partners and principals from Catamount are now part of Owl Ventures, which is the group’s first fund to exclusively back education tech companies.</p>
  <p>The San Francisco-based fund will invest up to $8m to lead Series A rounds, whilst contribute to Series B deals, for companies that deliver data-driven outcomes in US K-12 education space.</p>
  <p>Owl’s portfolio currently includes online literacy teacher Newsela, scholarship platform Raise and school survey provider Panorama Education.</p>
  <p>Most of the team came from Catamount Ventures, whose education portfolio includes Declara, MasteryConnect, Presence Learning, Revolution Foods, TenMarks, among others.

  <p class="text-info">Boston-based early-stage investment firm Point Judith Capital is back in the market targeting $100m for a fourth fund.</p>
  <p>That target is identical to the amount it aimed to collect for Point Judith Venture Fund III, which was launched in 2011. It is unclear whether the firm ever reached that target for Fund III – it had registered almost $25m for the vehicle by the end of 2012, but has not revealed any further fundraising information. Point Judith collected $78m during its second fundraise in 2007.</p>
  <p>The software and tech-focused firm says it typically invests between $500,000 and $3m in companies during the first financing round, reserving additional capital for subsequent funding rounds. It has previously invested in businesses such as e-commerce platform Kitsy Lane, DNA sequencer Nabsys and sports and events ticket management software maker SpotlightTMS.</p>
  <p>PJV co-founder and general partner David Martirano previously co-founded Rex Capital, leading its investments in Russian search engine Yandex and Co-nect, which it sold to Pearson. His fellow general partner and co-founder Sean Marsh began working with Point Judith in 2001 on behalf of village ventures, which he joined from TSG Equity Partners.</p>

  <p>US life science investor Hatteras Venture Partners has reached a first close of more than $90m for its fifth venture capital fund, AltAssets can reveal. Hatteras Venture Partners V (HVP V) is still some way off its $150m target, despite collecting $91m from 34 LPs according to a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
  <p>The fund’s predecessor, Hatteras Venture Partners IV, closed in January 2013 on $125m, six years after the closing of Hatteras Venture Partners III on $83m.

  <p>HVP V will focus on biopharmaceuticals, medical devices, diagnostics, healthcare IT, and related opportunities in human medicine, typically investing in companies located in the research-driven regions of North Carolina and the Southeastern United States.</p>
  <p>Its portfolio includes, mobile health program Wildflower Health, inhaled therapeutics developer Spyryx Biosciences and medical device company Contego Medical. In April, Australian venture capital firm Brandon Capital closed its third life sciences venture capital fund on A$200m ($154.5m).</p>

  <p>SEAM Fund II has raised just over $50m from 40 LPs according to a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.

  <p class="text-info">Dallas-based Traveller Capital appears to have held a first close on its second fund after collecting more than $14m, AltAssets can reveal.</p>
  <p>Traveller Capital Partners II is still some way off its $25m target despite collecting commitments from five LPs according to a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The filing also indicates that the firm was looking for minimum commitments of $75,000. If Fund II reaches its target it will be nearly three times the size of its predecessor, Traveller Capital Partners I, which closed in May 2014 on $9.3m, according to another regulatory filing.</p>
  <p>Traveller Capital primarily pursues smaller secondary transactions, which tend to be mature capital accounts (at least five years old) with net balances below $2m. The firm participates in transactions where an investor seeks to reduce private equity exposure, whether due to portfolio rebalancing, high opportunity costs for committed capital, or the administrative burden of the portfolio relative to incremental returns according to its website. In April, AltAssets reported that San Francisco-based Headlands Capital had launched its second secondaries fund.</p>

  <p class="text-info">Aberdeen Asset Management has launched what it’s calling the Aberdeen Alternative Strategies Fund (AASF), to give high net worth individuals, wealth managers and institutions exposure to “a portfolio of alternative strategies”.</p>
  <p>The fund has a minimum investment requirement of $100,000. Aberdeen said the fund’s launch would secure its position as one of the world’s largest managers of multi-manager liquid alternatives funds.</p>
  <p>The fund is being seeded by Aberdeen’s parent, Aberdeen Plc. According to Aberdeen, it has already attracted “significant early investment” from existing Aberdeen clients. It is described as being part of a wider strategy on Aberdeen’s part to diversify and grow its so-called Solutions business, and follows the recent announcement of Aberdeen’s acquisition of Arden Asset Management and Flag Capital Management.</p>
  <p>Following the completion of those transactions, Aberdeen’s alternatives platform will have total assets under management of more than $30bn, Aberdeen said. Unlike many alternative investment products, the AASF fund will provide investors with daily liquidity through a UCITS-regulated investment structure, making it more accessible to a wider range of investors, Aberdeen said. It said the fund’s portfolio had been constructed by the Aberdeen hedge funds team, making use of a pool of alternative investment managers who will run dedicated mandates within the fund. </p>
  <p>The 18-strong team is being led by Russell Barlow, who reports directly to Aberdeen’s global head of alternatives Andrew McCaffery. Aberdeen was created in 1983 through a management buy-out of an investment trust, and subsequently listed on the London Stock Exchange, where in 2012 it became a component company on the FTSE 100 Index.

  <p class="text-info">European venture capital firm Lakestar has closed its oversubscribed second fund on €350m, making it the firm’s largest fund to date.</p>
  <p>The new fund is a follow-up to the €135m ($154m) fund which launched two years ago. Lakestar II will focus primarily on early stage investments, and on growth stage investments when start-ups are looking to grow and scale. According to founder and chairman Klaus Hommels, the fund will target a ‘wide range of sectors’, and will focus on the US and Europe as it aims to ‘embrace’ connections between the two regions.</p>

While Hommels, a leading European business angel and venture capitalist, has been involved in numerous internet investments including Skype, Airbnb, Facebook, King.com, Xing and Spotify.</p>

  <p>The Lion-OCBC Capital Asia Fund I began fund-raising in November 2014, and was offered through OCBC Bank’s private equity investment entity, known as its Mezzanine Capital Unit.

  <p class="text-info">Dubai-based The Abraaj Group has closed its second dedicated North Africa private equity Fund at $375m.</p>
  <p>Abraaj North Africa Fund II (ANAF II) received support from a diverse group of new and existing investors. More than half the capital came from European and North American investors, with institutional investors, pension funds and development finance institutions accounting for 86 per cent.

  <p class="text-info">Joshua Baumgarten, a senior managing director at Blackstone, is going to Angelo, Gordon & Co  in the newly-created role of senior managing director and head of credit, beginning in 2016.</p>
  <p>Founded in 1988 and based in New York, Angelo, Gordon is a globally-focused alternative asset manager which currently looks after around $27bn on behalf of its clients, mainly by investing in credit, real estate and private equity. At Angelo, Gordon, Baumgarten will oversee the firm’s credit strategies — US and European Distressed, Leveraged Loans, RMBS/ABS/Whole Loans, CMBS, Middle Market Lending and Energy Lending, Angelo, Gordon said in a statement announcing Baumgarten’s appointment.</p>
  <p>The company’s credit portfolio managers, and their investment teams, remain the same, it said. Baumgarten will report to Michael Gordon, Angelo, Gordon’s co-founder and chief investment officer. Gordon said Baumgarten’s hiring came in response to the firm’s recent growth and diversification in the credit area, “as our clients continue to use credit as an important part of their asset allocation”. “We have intensified our distressed debt efforts in Europe, and added new origination teams in middle market lending and energy lending,” he added.</p>
  <p>“Josh’s role will be to continually enhance the success of our credit platform by working closely with each investment team, and our clients, to meet their return goals.” Baumgarten’s hiring comes a little less than two years after Angelo, Gordon named Larry Schloss president.

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter4-article3"></a><h2>Pierre Aubouin named to top roles at Caisse des Dépôts as investment mandate widens</h2>
  <p class="text-info">Pierre Aubouin has been named head of a newly-created Infrastructure & Transportation department of Caisse des Dépôts’ Investments & Local Development division, as well as chief executive of Caisse’s CDC Infrastructure  subsidiary. </p>
  <p>Aubouin’s appointment comes as the CDC Infrastructure investment team is being absorbed into the parent Caisse des Dépôts organisation, as part of an organisational transformation that is said to reflect a new and much broader investment strategy Caisse has taken on, in response to economic conditions in France.</p>
  <p>As part of its new mandate, Caisse des Dépôts will be looking to increase those of its investments that are seen as likely to directly benefit French territories and local authorities in particular, in an effort to amplify any upturns in the French economy. In the CDC Infra role, Aubouin succeeds Patrick Vandevoorde, who retired in July. Caisse des Dépôts is an arm of the French finance ministry that dates back to 1816, and which has been responsible ever since for ensuring that needed investments in the French economy are carried out. </p>
  <p>Its CDC Infrastructure arm, which was founded in 2010, has specialised in funding and overseeing public infrastructure investments and similar projects, such as transportation, energy infrastructure and telecommunications networks. Among its most notable projects have been the Sanef road toll payment network, Eurotunnel, and the Rhônexpress train line, which links downtown Lyon, France with its local airport.</p>
  <p>As of today, CDC Infra owns equity stakes in about 20 different projects, for a total cumulative investment of around €1.1bn, Aubouin said, and is comprised of an investment team of around 15 people. One of Aubouin’s roles at Caisse des Dépôts will be to oversee what is expected to be hundreds of millions of euros of annual infrastructure equity investments into French infrastructure projects assets, with a specific focus, according to Aubouin, on “greenfield projects and the transportation sector”.</p>
  <p>Prior to coming to Caisse des Dépôts, Aubouin had been chief financial officer with AREVA, the French-based nuclear energy conglomerate, and chief executive of its AREVA Business Support subsidiary. Before this, until 2011, he was with the French Government’s shareholding agency, known as APE (l’Agence des participations de l’État).</p>
  <p>Aubouin began his career in 1992 as an accountant with KPMG, subsequently joining McKinsey eight years later. At Caisse des Dépôts, he reports to Gabrielle Gauthey, who was appointed head of the new Investments & Local Development operation earlier this year. The existing CDC Infrastructure team is expected to move its offices later this year from Place de la Madeleine, in central Paris, to Avenue Pierre Mendès-France, in the Austerlitz district, where Caisse des Dépôts is based.</p>
