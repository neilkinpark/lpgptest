  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter1-article1"></a><h2>2015 on target to be among most lucrative for mid-market fundraising in last ten years</h2>
  <p class="text-info">This year could turn out to be one of the most lucrative for US mid-market private equity fundraising in the past ten years, new research suggests.</p>
  <p>About 59 per cent of global companies are now planning to acquire Only the back-to-back boom years of 2007 and 2008 would overtake 2015 and 2014 in terms of capital raised if the pace of fundraising maintains its momentum throughout the rest of the year, PitchBook’s US Middle Market Report for the fourth quarter reveals. That result will come largely thanks to the hefty $31bn in commitments PE fundraisers collected in 3Q, a 10 per cent quarter-on-quarter increase, the report said.</p>
  <p>PItchBook said the enthusiasm of limited partners for PE vehicles geared toward the middle market was the result of multiple factors, including better relative value in the mid-market, the relative outperformance of private equity in general and the increase in the number of PE fund managers since the turn of the century. It said, “Many other factors play a role, but those three in particular have ensured continued fundraising success for PE middle-market pools over the past few years.</p>
  <p>“The time taken to wrap up a fund this year is trending lower than nearly ever before, with buyout funds in particular edging below 13.5 months. Average fund size remains skewed higher than one would suspect given the proportion of funds in the $100m to $500m range, but that speaks to the recent success of some firms in navigating the upper mid-market as well as the entry of bigger PE firms that haven’t typically been focused on the middle market.</p>
  <p>“With 64 per cent of all funds closed in 2015 through the end of 3Q in the $100m to $500m range, the lower mid-market and core mid-market seem primed for the most activity on the investment side going forward. A considerable chunk of sizable funds will still be at play in the upper mid-market – facing what is likely to be a challenging environment for some time – with $64bn amassed in funds between $1bn and $5bn in size YTD.</p>
  <p>“At some point, however, a natural slackening of the fundraising cycle is to be expected, as most of the LPs looking to gain exposure to the space will have already subscribed to all the funds they intend to. When that will occur remains to be seen, although after such strong fundraising numbers over the past couple years, it wouldn’t be unreasonable to expect a slowdown sooner rather than later.” (65 per cent). </p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter1-article2"></a><h2>Certainty returns in Turkey post-election as local PE looks to two busy years ahead</h2>
  <p class="text-info">Last weekend’s election result is good news for the Turkish market as it brings much needed stability as local private equity prepares for two exit-packed years, GlobalturkCapital’s managing partner Baris Oney told AltAssets.</p>
  <p>He said, “We just had a General Election last Sunday with a big surprise to all polls –  the current governing party, the AKP, has won almost 50 per cent of the votes, with unofficial results showing record-high voter turnout of some 87 per cent. “This means a strong single-party government for four more years and obviously the big uncertainty, which had been a setback for the past two years, is now over and everyone knows what lies ahead.</p>
  <p>“We expect a very positive investment period ahead of us not just from the foreign investors but also from the Turkish business community. A lot of investments were held back due to the uncertainty, but now I expect an investment boom in the next two years. The big hold-up of Turkish businesses as well as investors in recent years is now expected to catalise the PE market in 2016 and 2017. Also the government has a big plan to re-initiate its structural and macro reforms under close to 30 headings, which is expected to boost the economy.”</p>
  <p>Fundraising activity will also accelerate after the election according to Oney. While prospects are good there are quite a few challenges in the Turkish market at the moment, the most serious being exits. Oney said, “The biggest challenge at the moment is exits, as private equity investors who have invested in Turkish companies in the past four to six years will look for new buyers and investors. Our estimation is that there are 150 such companies. We are to see 150+ exits in the next two years or so and almost all of them will be through trade sales since they are still small for IPO exits.</p>
  <p>“Also the GPs in Turkey do not have much experience in IPO exits and therefore their preference is trade sales or selling back to owners. These exits are very possible actually since there are numerous foreign and Turkish strategics wanting to acquire these companies.  The big issue will be valuations.” EY research of Turkish PE transactions in 2014 showed there was a considerable slowdown in the number and the volume of deals compared to the previous year.</p>
  <p>The number of PE deals done by private equity funds in Turkey fell to 43 from 74 in 2013, accounting for just 14 per cent of all M&A transactions (22 per cent in 2013).  The total volume of PE deals shrank to $343m in 2014 from $503m a year earlier. While a surge in the number of deals is expected in 2016 and 2017, in terms of returns private equity investors will have to count on outer factors as well. Oney said, “Good returns are possible at exits but it depends also on external factors such as the strong dollar.</p>
  <p>The Turkish Lira lost almost 36 per cent of its value in the last 12 months against the dollar and this blocks good returns. “I believe the devaluation trend will be over next year and good returns will become possible at exits. We certainly have regional and global risks as a country (Syria, Iraq, terrorism etc.), but I do not foresee them effecting investors’ appetite in Turkey,” Oney noted.There are a lot of GPs operating in Turkey but they are competing at the wrong end of the market, according to Oney.</p>
  <p>He said, “There are many GPs in the Turkish market, most of whom have been trying to invest large companies. “Although they all say mid-caps, in Turkish standards they want to invest in the top 1000-2000 local companies. Because of that, competition gets fierce when a good opportunity arises. On the contrary Turkey is an SME country, meaning the real private equity need exists for hundreds of thousands of SMEs. The ticket size for those are below $10m-$15m levels, whereas the current investors are looking for minimum ticket sizes of over $20m-$30m.</p>
  <p>“There is a mismatch in the market. Turkey needs numerous GPs who are willing to take the time to invest in SMEs rather than large companies. Having said that, there also exist good opportunities in the larger segment but private equity fund managers need to work harder to put together better investment strategies with them. Further the need to gain the trust of shareholders of large companies and prove to them the value of private equity investors more than cash. Fund managers need to work harder to generate deals. It is not quite possible to generate straightforward opportunities in the market.</p>
  <p>“We expect to see platform transactions, meaning sector consolidation plays. This will require working more closely with the right advisors and venture partners. They need to work with venture partners like GlobalTurk Capital to be able to invest in these deals, as you have to have a strong local presence to be able to invest in Turkish SMEs from abroad.”</p>
  <p>While big international institutions have been keen on investing in Turkey in recent years and have been active in the local market, private investors have been predominantly hesitant so far. Oney said, “The EBRD, IFC, EIF and most other IFIs were already quite bullish about Turkey, but we have yet to see private LPs, who have been holding up for some time. “All the big IFIs have already invested in Turkey through GPs and are considering putting more money into the existing fund managers and first time funds and first time managers.</p>
  <p>“They are also making direct investments. We have mostly US, European and Middle Eastern GPs looking into investment opportunities. There are a number of existing GPs and new managers in the process of fund raising. Other than IFIs, all other types have been rather silent in the past year or two, but I expect them to start considering investing in Turkey again. I believe Turkey will emerge as one of the top countries among the emerging markets where investors will consider seriously putting money into next year.”</p>
  <p>A $100m flex fund it is raising with SEAF  is expected to hold its first close by the end of 2015, Oney said. Raising in the other flexible emerging markets fund has been shelved for the time being due to the uncertainty in the local market over the past year. However, GlobalTurk is planning to “give it a boost” in 2016, Oney added.</p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter1-article3"></a><h2>New dawn for India’s private equity</h2>
  <p class="text-info">India’s business giants are turning their hands to private equity, both at the corporate and personal level. Arvind Mathur, president of the IVCA, says the industry will benefit from economic reforms and the opening up of institutional markets.</p>
  <p>India’s business families are rich, powerful and highly influential. Families such as Birla, Mahindra, Jindal, Murugappa, Godrej and Kirloskar control vast empires worth billions. Top of the tree is Tata, headed until recently by Ratan Tata. Tata Group has so many subsidiaries they need an alphabetical index to list them on the website. Its interests include automotive (Jaguar Land Rover, Tata Motors), telecoms (Tata Communications), steel (Tata Steel), retail (Infiniti Retail) and private equity (Tata Capital). Tata accounts for 7.6 per cent of the Bombay Stock Exchange’s market capitalisation.</p>
  <p>When Mr Tata speaks, India listens. He may have stepped down as chairman of Tata Group last year, but his every move is still followed closely. So, when he started ploughing his personal fortune – estimated at more than US$1bn – into startups, the business community took notice and the domestic press devoted page after page to his every investment.</p>
  <p>Over the past 12 months, Mr Tata has invested in microfinancier Grameen Capital, mobile payments firm Paytm, online car dealer CarDekho, healthcare provider Swasth India, online furniture retailer Urban Ladder, online jewellery retailer Bluestone, India’s largest online retailer Snapdeal, and Alteros Energies, a Bostonbased wind-energy company.</p>
  <p>“I would like to see more widespread knowledge of private equity and venture capital amongst domestic LPs and potential LPs,” says Arvind Mathur, president of the Indian Private Equity and Venture Capital Association (IVCA). “We’re seeing ultra high net worth individuals like Ratan Tata investing in venture capital opportunities in a personal capacity. This is great because it will have a demonstration effect where more and more domestic institutions and high net worth individuals would consider this a legitimate asset class.</p>
  <p>“We’re also seeing more entrepreneurs who have made exits, and have a significant amount of capital to invest, looking at the space. They are saying ‘I have succeeded and sold my company for, say, US$200m, and I want to invest in more startups’. This is terrific. What’s special about this is that sometimes entrepreneurs might say ‘Hey, look, this is a fund set up by an entrepreneur – I would rather work with a venture capital fund which is run by entrepreneurs because they understand what I’m going through, what help I need and what sort of mentorship I need’. There is a nice sort of tension between the mainstream venture capital funds and these ultra high net worth individuals who are investing in the same space.”</p>
  <p>But does this halo extend as far as domestic institutions, which are restricted from investing in private equity? “It would create a really nice environment if the government could actually enable pension funds to invest in private equity and venture capital. “It would be very well received if the matters of permanent establishment and safe harbour could be perfected. If that could be achieved it would be great – really great – for India. I think the government does believe in these concepts, so I wouldn’t be surprised if these changes do take place in the near future.”</p>
  <p>Mathur says there is growing recognition that private equity not only generates good investment returns, but plays a significant role in the wider economy. “Private equity is helping grow companies,” he says. “That in turn creates jobs, which is very positive for the economy. Every day newspapers are full of stories of capital coming into new and innovative companies, which is viewed very favourably by policymakers.”</p>
  <p>Even if the regulations change, Mathur believes it will be some time before Indian institutions are playing a significant role as capital provider to the industry. At present, 85-90 per cent of funds are from international sources. “Domestic funding of private equity will grow, but it will grow gradually,” says Mathur. “It will grow gradually because domestic pension funds will have to increase their own skills-set, they will need to learn how to select managers, they will need to learn how to manage their investments and they will need to learn how they should act as responsible LPs. They will be on a learning curve for some time.”</p>
  <p>The Indian stock rose more than 30 per cent in 2014, buoyed by the election of the first single-party majority government in more than 30 years. “The election has created an optimistic environment among Indian businessmen and Indian investors as well as foreign investors and private equity funds,” says Mathur. “The new government has definitely been pro-business, but they need to do more. They need to be a little bit more aggressive in promoting reforms in the country.”</p>
  <p>Backed by the stronger macroeconomic landscape, PE activity continues to play a pivotal role, accounting for 53 per cent of foreign direct investment inflows. India’s GDP grew by 6.6 per cent from 2013 to 2014, compared with 4.9 per cent from 2012 to 2013, according to CEIC Data. The services sector experienced particularly strong growth, and its contribution to GDP climbed to 51 per cent in 2014, with trade, hotels, transport, communication and related services growing by nearly 11 per cent.</p>
  <p>PE investments in India saw a robust increase over 2013. The number of funds investing in India grew at a phenomenal rate, rising nearly 30 per cent over 2013. Of 436 funds that made investments, close to 50 per cent were doing so for the first time in the past three years. Deal value, including real estate, infrastructure and venture capital deals, increased by 28 per cent to $15.2bn, inching closer to 2007 peak levels of $17.1bn, according to Bain & Company’s India Private Equity Report 2015. Overall deal volume in India grew by 14 per cent in 2014, with early- and growth-stage deals accounting for 80 per cent of transactions.</p>
  <p>The consumer technology sector led in both deal value and volume, constituting 31 per cent of value and 35 per cent of overall volume. The largest was a $1bn investment in e-commerce company Flipkart in July 2014, led by the firm’s existing venture backers, which include Accel Partners, Naspars, DST Global, Iconiq Capital and Tiger Global. The round also saw Singaporean sovereign wealth fund GIC come on board.</p>
  <p>Highlighting the almost insatiable demand for e-commerce investments, Flipkart raised a further $700m in December 2014 from international investors, including Baillie Gifford, Greenoaks Capital, Steadview Capital, T Rowe Price Associates and the Qatar Investment Authority, taking the total raised since Accel injected $1m in 1999 to more than $2.45bn. Most of the capital coming into private equity India is in the hands of international firms, whether it be global buyout giants like KKR, TPG and Warburg Pincus, or Silicon Valley venture firms like Accel. But all these firms are tapping into a vast Indian talent pool.</p>
  <p>“Even though the GPs may be owned by foreign firms, they are entirely staffed by Indian professionals with MBAs or chartered accountant qualifications,” says Mathur. “They are people who are networked locally, who have a sense of what is happening locally, or they are from the category of Indians who have returned to India after living in the West for many years.”</p>
  <p>Mathur welcomes international funds, who he says help raise the bar for domestic players. “The international funds bring a lot of experience; experience built up over decades. So, while many of the domestic funds are of relatively recent origin, the people who are in them have experience gained in international funds.”</p>
  <p>India’s powerful business groups are not just active in the venture capital space – many are setting up later stage private equity funds. “Indian promoters have started their own private equity general partner practices,” says Mathur. “What a group like Tata brings to the table is an extraordinarily high level of corporate governance practices. They are highly respected. They manage their conflicts of interests quite well and are able to attract longterm private equity capital from international limited partners.”</p>
  <p>Buyouts are not yet a feature of the market because of central bank regulations. “Lending in buyout situations is relatively uncommon,” says Mathur. “The central bank has regulated the banks and they have constraints on lending for different purposes. What that essentially means is that leveraged buyouts are something they cannot fund, at least not in the domestic market. There have been leveraged buyouts of international acquisitions by Indian companies, but for domestic deals the product is absent in India.” </p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter1-article4"></a><h2>Macroeconomic woes affecting PE fundraising in Brazil</h2>
  <p class="text-info">The recent macroeconomic slowdown in Brazil is setting back private equity activity in the country, making the fundraising environment more challenging, Nicolas Wollak, founder of Axxon Group told AltAssets.</p>
  <p>And this trend needs to continue if one wants to ensure the Axxon recently closed their third Brazil-focused fund at the $400m hard cap, enjoying stronger activity from investors. “We had more demand that we could accommodate,” Wollak said. According to him, the higher demand was because the fundraising was earlier this year. He said, “The fund was raised in the first half of 2015 when the fundraising environment was considerably better than in the second half.</p>
  <p>“Now the environment is a lot more difficult than it was in the past three to five years in Brazil. The macroeconomic and political situation in the country is cause for concern and makes it more challenging [to raise funds].” Gross domestic product (GDP) growth in Brazil has nearly diminished over the past decade, according to the latest World Bank report about the country. GDP growth halved from 4.5 per cent in 2006-2010 to 2.1 per cent over 2011-2014, ending last year at just 0.1 per cent. Inflation remains high, ending 2014 at 6.4 per cent.</p>
  <p>To address the current macro imbalances and revitalise growth, the authorities have formulated primary surplus targets for 2015 and 2016 (at 1.2 per cent and 2 per cent of GDP, respectively), compared with a primary deficit of 0.6 per cent and an overall deficit of 6.7 per cent of GDP in 2014, the World Bank says. In Wollak’s assessment Brazil’s economy will need at least a few years to reach a point of recovery.</p>
  <p>He said, “We expect the macroeconomic situation in Brazil to become more difficult next year, but the worsening is like to happen at a slower pace than in 2015. There are no prospects for a recovery soon. It will be more a medium-term thing.”  Analysing the macroeconomic trends in Brazil, a report from the Centre for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR) suggests that Brazil’s monetary policy over the past five years indicates “that the Central Bank has sometimes been too willing to sacrifice economic growth in order to push inflation down, even when the inflation comes from external sources [such as commodity prices]”. This has effectively slowed growth down to a hold.</p>
  <p>Wollak said, “However, there still is a certain number of long-term investors who believe now is a good time to make new investments in Brazil with fund managers who have good experience and track record. At this point we are seeing investors predominantly from the US. The latest Axxon fund was backed mostly by endowments and pension funds [from North America].” Axxon Group will stick to its established strategy. Wollak said, “Investments as with funds so far will focus on the lower to mid segment of the Brazilian market and we are looking primarily at control investments.</p>
  <p>“Individual commitments will be in the range of $25m to $75m. We have a number of transactions in process lined-up for the new fund. We expect to close at least a couple of deals over the next 60 to 120 days. The investments are in the energy and infrastructure services sectors of the market.” Founded in 2001, the Axxon Group is a value-oriented private equity firm that focuses on the mid-cap market in Brazil. The group targets control and significant minority investments in high-quality businesses that have significant untapped potential for revenue and EBITDA growth.</p>
  <p>Axxon’s target investments usually range between $15m and $50m. Including co-investments from third parties, since its inception, Axxon has deployed over $320m in eleven platform companies in addition to ten add-on acquisitions.</p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter1-article5"></a><h2>Jaguar looks to exploit the troubled Brazilian market and seize long term opportunities</h2>
  <p class="text-info">Despite the macroeconomic problems and risks associated with Brazil and Latin America, Jaguar Growth Partners managing director Gary Garrabrant believes this is perfect time to seize the long term opportunities.</p>
  <p>“The current market is troubling and even the smartest investors would agree that there is little visibility in terms of a turnaround in multiple countries, beginning with Brazil. In fact, we don’t think it’s reached the bottom quite yet. The barrier entries into Brazil are very high, it’s a very challenging place even for the simplest of things.”</p>
  <p>Despite the slowdown Jaguar Growth Partners, a private equity firm focused exclusively on real assets in growth markets globally, recently announce the opening of its office in Sao Paulo, Brazil. “We view Brazil as one of our most important markets, we have a 20-year history of investing in Brazil and we are big believers in the Country long term. Marry that with the kind of unsettled economic conditions and it seems like the ideal time to open the office and absence of visibility, we are ideally positioned to establish a presence.</p>
  <p>Despite the slowdown Jaguar Growth Partners, a private equity firm focused exclusively on real assets in growth markets globally, recently announce the opening of its office in Sao Paulo, Brazil. “We view Brazil as one of our most important markets, we have a 20-year history of investing in Brazil and we are big believers in the Country long term. Marry that with the kind of unsettled economic conditions and it seems like the ideal time to open the office and absence of visibility, we are ideally positioned to establish a presence.</p>
  <p>Nicolas Wollak, founder of Axxon Group, recently told AltAsets that the macroeconomic and political situation in the country is cause for concern and the environment is a lot more difficult than it was in the past three to five years. Even though Jagaur sees it as a good time to open an office, Garrabrant added there are concerns over the increasing number of risks in the country and the continent. Timing Currency relationships are now is a big major issue, with currency devaluation against the US dollar people now see the market in Brazil and other emerging markets as being volatile. But we see opportunity on the horizon as prices of good assets come down.</p>
  <p>“Of course it appreciates over time but over the last two years there has been extreme volatility and those with legacy assets are finding they are mispriced or priced downwards.” With currency being an issue, Garrabrant adds that there is no cost-effective way to hedge, and like most medium-term investor they choose not to. “We don’t hedge, instead we use modest levels of local debt as a natural hedge. We generally invest in business where the rent can adjust to inflation and so that is a form of hedging.”</p>
  <p>Another risk is being too ambitious according to Garrabrant as many inexperienced investors have the tendency of taking on more than can be achieved and end up failing. “Despite this we have always been big fans of Brazil for many reasons, one of which is the scale of the population, combined with the diversify in the country.</p>
  <p>The Country is really set up like parallels the lower 48 states in the US where there is a defined geography. So there is a south east, which gets the most attention, but also a South, Northeast, a Central and a North. Each of these are distinct and each of these present a different business opportunity like they do in the US. “The population is large and the average age is low, which in turn leads to a very high rate of household formation. This leads to a very high, long-term demand for housing and at the moment there isn’t enough supply. For the right investor, that’s an opportunity.” </p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter1-article6"></a><h2>Africa’s decade is ahead of us, so time is right to invest, DBL Partners exec says</h2>
  <p class="text-info">Africa’s readiness to embrace development and growth was the motivation behind DBL Partners‘ first investment outside the US, managing director Nancy Pfund has told AltAssets.</p>
  <p>Pfund said, “Any time when you look at the continent, it feels like Africa over the next decade will be very different than in the last and it is ready to really increase the size of its middle class, the opportunities for citizens as well as its ability to join the world of lights and electricity, and everything that goes with that in terms of quality of life, jobs and business creation. We think this is Africa’s decade ahead of us, [with it being the home of a big part] of the 1.3bn people not having electricity on our planet. And that number is growing.</p>
  <p>“Many of the lessons we have learned about solar power in the US market are now ready to implement in Africa.” DBL Partners, a US private equity firm which hopes its investments will have a positive social impact as well as financial returns closed its third fund at $400m in June 2015, making its first investment abroad – providing $10.5m in a $25m Series C round in Tanzania-based Off Grid Electric. Fundraising went well, she said, with DBL enjoying a lot of interest from investors.</p>
  <p>Pfund commented, “We were so gratified, we actually had to turn away investors. There is a huge level of interest in impact investing among all – pension funds, endowments, family offices, foundations, even utilities. Impact investing allows you to make good level returns while addressing the most important problems of our age and to use the entrepreneurial economy to drive innovative solutions and job creation.   </p>
  <p>“We have been doing this for a while, this is not a new idea for us. Our first fund is a vintage 2004, so we have been at this, we have case studies, we have good returns. What we have been excited about is the level of interest and the desire on the part of a very diverse array of investors to jump in and join the impact investment movement. Most investors in the fund are from the US, there are some from Europe. With Fund III this is the first time that we have actually had a sizable presence of non-US investors.</p>
  <p>“We do not have investors from Africa now but we are in the process of building our network now. So, for our fourth fund, whenever that is, I expect we could have some African investors. Since the announcement we have received a lot of new deals so we are currently looking at which ones to choose as next investments. There is definitely more capital left in Fund III for future allocations. The average size of the seven investments made so far from the fund is around the amount we have invested in Off Grid Electric.”</p>
  <p>“This fund is a big step forward for our firm [giving it the scope] to invest abroad and specifically in Africa, so this is a big milestone for us. We are not going to do tonnes of deals abroad right at the beginning because we do not have that capability and also we want to do our investments very systematically and make sure that we are learning as we go so we can build an international presence over time. Reasons to choose Off Grid Electric in Africa was both because we saw track investment opportunity and because of the impact.</p>
  <p>“We are double bottom line, this is what DBL stands for. We want to make a big impact both in terms of our investment returns and our ability to catalise social improvement. [In terms of solar energy] Tanzania has very thriving market and the president there has committed to a million solar-roofs programme by 2017 and that’s a great market.  Rwanda is also a market we are looking very closely at and then we are going to choose a few more African countries over the next year or so. We have not decided on which markets would that be yet.</p>
  <p>“[On potential risks in those markets] We are dealing with a population that does not have the level of income like people in the US, so the risk is if they would be able to afford these systems and not have too much of a dent in their take-home pay. But so far given the level of adoption we have seen that enough people in Africa are able to afford it.</p>
  <p>“Furthermore, they are already paying for kerosene, mobile phones, so when you add it all up in some cases they could get electricity even for less. But there is still a big need of educating customers. Even in the US we are still educating people how cost-effective solar power can actually be.” London.</p>

  <p class="text-info">The $175bn-managing Florida State Board of Administration has revealed close to $900m of new commitments across a string of private equity, real estate and energy investment vehicles.</p>
  <p>The firm’s biggest new commitment was $200m to Blackstone Tactical Opportunities Fund II according to P&I, which cited an email from FSBA communications manager John Kuczwanski. He said the LP had also committed $150m to Ardian Secondary Fund VII, $125m to TrueBridge-Kauffman Fellows Endowment Fund, and $50m each to Accel-KKR Capital Partners V and American Industrial Partners Capital Fund VI.</p>
  <p>Ardian is currently believed to be targeting up to $9bn for its seventh secondaries fund. The firm, formerly known as AXA Private Equity, is looking to launch the fund imminently according to PEI. In April last year, Ardian closed its Secondary Fund VI on $9bn and it could be looking to exceed that amount with the new vehicle.

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter2-article3"></a><h2>Misalignment pushing PGGM to more direct PE despite improving transparency, exec says</h2>
  <p class="text-info">Transparency in fees and costs is improving in the private equity industry, but the change will not happen overnight according to PGGM’s Ruulke Bagijn. </p>
  <p>The chief investment officer at the Dutch investment group told AltAssets, “The biggest challenge for pension funds is a combination of transparency and high costs.” In August, PGGM became the latest LP to take action against the growing debate over fees paid by pension funds by issuing what it says are “new guidelines” setting out what it considers to be “acceptable remuneration” for asset management services.</p>
  <p>So far this year, California’s state treasurer, John Chiang, urged California Public Employees’ Retirement System and the California State Teachers’ Retirement System to work for state legislation, forcing private equity firms to disclose all fees charged. While a coalition of state treasurers and elected officials put pressure on the SEC to push for greater transparency and fee disclosures from PE managers.</p>
  <p>“Transparency is improving and you are also seeing more and more standardised reporting on fees and costs which really helps to give insight to see where the costs are being made in a sector. We have already seen improvements in the terms itself, especially in the large buyouts, so I do think the industry is changing. But this will not happen overnight and I have said this before, it will take quite some time. There is no reason to be romantic about this, it is about realistically focusing on it and gradually, step by step, we will see progress.”</p>
  <p>Last week, the €187bn pension manager said it was preparing to take certain steps to invest more directly in private equity. In private equity it currently invests through external manager funds, however it began doing all infrastructure deals directly itself in 2009 (with a legacy portfolio consisting of funds pre-2009). Its private real estate is currently through fund managers it selects, but it now develops more and more joint ventures with private real estate parties.</p>
  <p>Bagijn said, “There is a little bit more to it than we are only going to more direct private equity. It is part of a broader vision in which we say we are PGGM, we work for pension funds and it needs to be very clear on who side we are. That is because sometimes there is misalignment with the asset management industry. She said the new strategy will be in the space between private equity and infrastructure.</p>
  <p>“So you can say its infrastructure plus or core private equity, but what it is all about is equity investments in an area that is non-core infrastructure or you can say its private equity with a lower risk profile. We are making equity investments which we think are suitable for us as a long term investors, which you can hold of a longer period of time, use less leverage, have lower operational and we think we can do that directly because we build on the experience and expertise we build in the infrastructure area.”</p>
  <p>PGGM said it wants to use its in-house team, build capacity to invest it that space and build portfolios that sit very well with the pension funds it invests with. Bagijn added, “The move is part of a broader mission whereby we say we have experienced misalignment sometimes with the asset management industry which relates to high costs, not always full transparency and difference in desired hold periods over investments.</p>
  <p>“It also the kind of the experience of being closer to your portfolio so you actually know much better what is in it, and if you have better control over what you select to be part of the portfolio you can actually build portfolios that have a better fit with the pension funds we invest for.” GPs have recently expressed a worry about LPs going direct, and in turn competing with one another, however Bagijn stressed that PGGM will not competing with its GPs in private equity.</p>
  <p>“We are trying to find more products and this is a potential product where we think we can do more ourselves. Generally in the private industry there is a movement and there change and I think some GPs will ask the questions what that means for them. However we still have a global private equity mandate, which we will work with external managers, but we see opportunities to further expand our direct investment approach in the private markets. GPs have nothing to worry about because our global private equity mandate doesn’t change and we want to continue to work with those managers, that won’t change.” </p>

  <p>Fund V also includes a $5m commitment from the GP. Last year, AltAssets reported that the fund had landed $178m in commitments, with the first sale occurring in late October 2014. According to its website its investors are located in the US, Canada, Europe and Middle East and include public and private defined benefit retirement plans, endowments and foundations, family offices, wealth management firms, healthcare entities and financial institutions.</p>
  <p>The new fund comes over three since the closing of its predecessor, which completed fundraising in August 2012 on $403m. Like the prior fund, Fund V will make investments in the secondary market, focusing on small transactions in buyout and venture capital funds.</p>

  <p class="text-info">Lower mid-market investment firm GMB Mezzanine Capital, which is managed by Lakeside Capital Management, has registered $112.3m to date for its third fund, AltAssets can reveal.</p>
  <p>The firm is targeting up to $125m for GMB Mezzanine Capital III according to an SEC filing, an identical amount to its second fund which closed in 2012. That vehicle ultimately collected $240m thanks to its status as a Small Business Investment Company, a scheme which can see it receive matched capital from the US Government. It is unclear from the filing whether Fund III has also been registered as an SBIC. The firm’s first fund invested a total of $207m in 29 portfolio companies between 2005 and 2010.</p>
  <p>GMB expects to complete the fundraising within a year, a SEC filing shows. The first sale of securities was made in August. Equus Financial Consulting and CoBiz are acting as placement agents in the fundraise, the filing adds. GMB targets US companies with total enterprise values under $100m and annual revenue in the $10m to $200m range. The company invests in a variety of leveraged acquisition, recapitalization, growth/expansion and buyout transactions. Target investment sizes stand between $3m and $18m. </p>

  <p class="text-info">Roger Yates, chairman at UK-based private equity firm Electra, has resigned from his position following the appointment of activist investor Edward Bramson to the board.</p>
  <p>At a shareholder meeting earlier this week, investors voted 53.5 per cent in favour of the resolution by Bramson’s investment vehicle Sherborne to appoint Bramson to the board. Following the decision, Electra chairman Roger Yates announced his resignation and looks set to be replaced by non-executive director and former Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee member Kate Barker on an interim basis.</p>
  <p>The decision brings an end to an 18 month battle between the American investor and the British buyout house, with Bramson disputing criticizing Electra for a lack of openness, claiming there is more value to be found in the company’s portfolio. In March 2014, Sherborne acquired a stake in Electra Private Equity. In the same month, Bramson increased his stake in the private equity firm, rising his interest from 13.7 per cent to 18.39.</p>
  <p>Later that year, Sherborne sent a letter to the firm saying it could implement a strategic review which would create more than £1bn of value. However, its proposal to appoint Bramson and chairman Ian Brindle to Electra’s board failed after more than 60 per cent of attending shareholders voted against the move. Shortly after their decision, Electra announced plans to review its fee arrangements after Sherborne’s proposal uncovered areas of discontent among its shareholders. </p>
