  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter1-article1"></a><h2>Silicon Valley venture confidence slips again despite strong exit markets</h2>
  <p class="text-info">Confidence in the Silicon Valley venture capital community has declined again despite expectations of a continued strong exit market, new research suggests.</p>
  <p>The latest Silicon Valley Capitalist Confidence Index for the second quarter measured 3.73 on a five-point scale, with five indicating high confidence and one low confidence. That was a drop from the previous quarter’s index of 3.81, and marks an ongoing dip in confidence as the following graph shows. The report said the good exit market effect had been mitigated by increasing concern about high valuations of venture-backed companies.</p>
  <p>It added that the uncertainty over the entry of new types of investors, the rising cost of doing business in Silicon Valley and the potential fallout of macro environment issues, such as in China and the EU, also gave pause to some venture investors. The report said, “The modest decline in confidence came amidst strong industry metrics in VC fundraising and investments, and exits of venture-backed firms. For example, the NVCA and Thomson Reuters reported the highest level of venture capital fund-raising since 2007.</p>
  <p>“Of course, the greater supply of funds available also makes possible the higher levels of valuations that give some venture capitalists pause. The NVCA and PWC also reported the highest level of venture investments since Q4 2000. This wave of capital being put to work will certainly nourish new venture creation and innovation while also providing the demand that drives up valuations for the most promising projects.</p>
  <p>“IPO activity for venture-backed firms in Q2 also increased significantly from the previous quarter but was down from the year earlier quarter, signalling a healthy exit environment but one that is not operating at the same pace of VC fundraising and investments. Despite the overall strong venture business model metrics, the Silicon Valley Venture Capitalist Confidence Index edged lower in Q2 as it matched its 11-year average of 3.73, its lowest point in two years.”</p>
  <p>Igor Sill of Geneva Venture Management told he report authors, “I sense that continued new IPO activity and cash-rich treasuries at Amazon, Apple, Cisco, eBay, EMC, HP, Microsoft, Oracle, Salesforce will yield high valuation acquisitions of venture-backed startups. “Shareholders are embracing acquisitions that promise greater market share and growth opportunities. Surprisingly, the stock prices of the acquiring companies have tended to appreciate even higher with smart acquisitions as evidenced by the volume of global M&A which surged to $2 trillion for the year.</p>
  <p>“The robust rebound of the US economy gives me confidence that the recovery will continue to lift venture’s positive momentum.” Similarly, Sandy Miller of Institutional Venture Partners commented “After a surprisingly slow start, the IPO market for venture-backed tech companies has begun to accelerate. “I think 2015 will finish strong and carry over in 2016.” Mr. Miller added “There are some amazing companies that have filed confidentially.”</p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter1-article2"></a><h2>Corporate venture makes biggest contribution to US startups since 2008</h2>
  <p class="text-info">Corporate venture capital investors have made their biggest percentage contribution to US startups in almost seven years.</p>
  <p>Groups in the corporate venture sector deployed $1.6bn to the early-stage ecosystem in the second quarter according to the latest MoneyTree Report from PricewaterhouseCoopers in association with the National Venture Capital Association. The 132 corporate venture groups accounted for 9.2 per cent of total venture dollars in the quarter and took part in almost one in five deals – the strongest quarter by number of deals since Q3 2008.</p>
  <p>NVCA president and CEO Bobby Franklin said, “Once again, we see strong participation by corporate venture groups in the entrepreneurial ecosystem, helping to nurture and grow innovative startup companies across all sectors of our economy. “Through the first half of the year, corporate venture groups accounted for 12.5 per cent of total venture investment, which would make 2015 the busiest year for corporate venture activity since 2001 should this pace continue.</p>
  <p>“As the ecosystem continues to cement itself as a central pillar of the U.S. economy, it’s critical to have corporate venture groups at the table playing such an important role in its growth.” Similar to overall trends in venture capital, software companies led the way, receiving $1.5bn in 207 deals through the first half of 2015. That represented 40 per cent of overall corporate venture investing.</p>
  <p>Coming in second was the industrial/energy sector which received $1bn in 23 deals, accounting for 27 per cent of overall corporate venture investing and 59 per cent of total venture capital investment in the sector. That result suggested significant interest in cleantech and energy companies by corporate groups, the report said. Biotechnology companies received the third largest total investment amount by corporate venture groups so far in 2015, with $513m going into 60 deals, representing 13.4 per cent of overall corporate venture investing.</p>
  <p>Corporate venture investing in the life sciences sector, which includes biotechnology and medical devices, totaled $584m in 79 deals coming from 39 corporate ventures groups through the first half of the year. As a percentage of overall venture investing in life sciences companies in 2015, corporate venture represented 11.5 per cent of all dollars invested and participated in 19.7 per cent of deals.</p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter1-article3"></a><h2>Lack of buyout deals push PE firms towards dividend loans</h2>
  <p class="text-info">Dividend loans for US private equity firms has reached its highest rate since the third quarter of 2013, AltAssets understands.</p>
  <p>A lack of new buyout deals is leaving investors with few other lending options, and there is an increase in PE firms borrowing to finance dividend payments from portfolio companies according to Thomson Reuters LPC data. Nearly $8.3bn of dividend recapitalisation deals have been announced since July 1, according to LPC data, including a $2.875bn deal for contract research firm Pharmaceutical Product Development (PPD)</p>
  <p>This total is already higher than $7bn in the second quarter and $3.35bn in the first quarter. It is also the highest figure since $11.3bn in the third quarter of 2013, when dividend recapitalisation deals hit an annual record volume of $50bn. The increase in dividend deals is due to the high equity valuations and efforts by federal regulators to cap highly leveraged buyouts according to Reuters.</p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter1-article4"></a><h2>Growing US concern over ‘ginormous’ private equity fees spreads to Australia, Netherlands</h2>
  <p class="text-info">The recent and growing debate over the undisclosed fees paid by pension funds and other private equity fund clients has reached Australia, with a major financial publication there reporting that the country’s corporate regulator is being urged to “clamp down on ‘ginormous’ private equity fees”, in the wake of recent US revelations and debate on the matter.</p>
  <p>Meantime, the Wall Street Journal is reporting today that PGGM, the Dutch pension fund giant, “will stop investing in outside money managers, including private-equity firms, that don’t fully disclose their fees”. PGGM “is worried that the pensions of its clients – social workers and nurses – are being undermined by high fees”, the WSJ report says. According to a lead article posted on its website on Wednesday evening Australia time, the Australian Financial Review (AFR) reports that the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) “is being urged to crack down on the disclosure of fees by private equity firms, amid fears local super funds and investors are being gouged”.</p>
  <p>The AFR’s use of the word ‘ginormous’ in its headline – explained later in the story – is a reference to comments made by US economist Eileen Appelbaum, who was quoted two days ago in the Los Angeles Times as saying that the amounts such California pension funds as CalPERS  are set to reveal they have paid in private equity in performance fees “are going to be ginormous, and public officials are going to ask whether these payments … are warranted”. Appelbaum is identified by the LA Times as a senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a Washington think tank, and author of Private Equity at Work: When Wall Street Manages Main Street.</p>
  <p>As reported here on Monday,  the LA Times coverage coincided with another article on a related topic in the Financial Times the same day, which reported that a UK academic had weighed into the growing debate over undisclosed private equity fees in the US. The academic, Ludovic Phalippou, a finance professor at the University of Oxford Saïd Business School, told the FT that the total amount CalPERS had failed to disclose that it had paid for private equity services over an 18-year-period was “at least $5bn”.</p>
  <p>The LA Times coverage followed other press reports out of the US in July that a group of states and cities were getting together to urge the US Securities & Exchange Commission to ask it to insist on greater transparency and more frequent disclosures by private equity funds.</p>
  <p>Back in Australia, in addition to the undisclosed-payments-for-private-equity-services-by-California-pension-funds debate,  the news, in late June – that US private equity giant KKR is to pay nearly $30m to settle SEC charges that it had misallocated more than $17m in expenses to its clients – has also caught the attention of Australia’s financial services industry and its watchdogs, the Australian Financial Review story on Wednesday noted.</p>
  <p>An Australian angle to the story came on Wednesday, the AFR said, in the form of news that the Australian regulator had demanded that Ausbil Investment Management, a A$10.2bn Australian asset manager for major superannuation funds, institutional investors and master trust clients, pay A$18m in compensation to investors for overcharging its clients between December 2004 and January 2014.</p>
  <p>“The debate has driven local A$57bn fund manager IFM Investors to unveil an ‘investment partnership model’ to bypass the private equity industry, to invest between A$50m and A$150m directly in Australian companies,” the AFR article went on. It then quoted ASIC as saying that it was closely monitoring investor overcharging, and that it claimed that its recent work in this area “had resulted in more than A$60m in compensation being refunded, including from NAB Wealth, Macquarie Investment Management and Bank of Queensland.”</p>
  <p>Like the US and UK, Australia has recently overhauled its regulations governing the way financial products are marketed and sold in a way that is aimed at making them more transparent, and fees and other charges more obvious. In Australia, the legislation is known as the Future of Financial Advice reforms. These were signed into law in 2011, but amended to be less onerous for businesses to comply with after Tony Abbott was elected prime minister in 2013.</p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter1-article5"></a><h2>LPs more comfortable with Europe now than 18 months ago, says Castik exec</h2>
  <p class="text-info">Non-European Investors have become more comfortable with the political and economical uncertainty in Europe over the last 18 months according to Castik Capital investment partner Michael Phillips.</p>
  <p>Earlier this week, Luxembourg-based Castik Capital sealed one of the largest first-time fundraises on the continent by hitting its €1bn hard cap, after just 18 months on the road. Philips told AltAssets, “Fundraising is always hard work. We had a first close in June 2014, took a six month break to complete our first deal, and then resumed fund-raising in early 2015. Start to finish it took about 18 months.</p>
  <p>The fund, European Private Investment Club I, sourced commitments from five institutional investors in total, across Europe, Asia and North America. Philips admits the large majority of LPs wouldn’t even consider backing a firm’s first fund, which is partly why the firm took a six month break to complete the first deal. He added that when Castik hit the fundraising trail, LPs allocations, opinions and confidence for Europe was completely different to now.</p>
  <p>“Right now I would say that the fundraising environment is very positive, but looking back over the 18 month time period we covered with our fundraising, we noticed two key items. “The first point is that many investors stated they are under allocated to Europe, and within their allocations, they tended to be under allocated to the mid-market and well allocated to the large cap market.</p>
  <p>“Secondly, we have noticed a positive shift in the general outlook towards Europe, especially from non-European investors looking to increase their allocation to the continent.” Positive macroeconomic developments and the increased value of assets have both contributed to that change according to Phillips. “Many investors are seeing the valuations of their portfolios increase, and they have been receiving lots of distributions back, as private equity funds make disposals.</p>
  <p>“That combination tends to lower their percentage allocation to private equity and, in turn, drives their demand for the product.” In addition, a personal observation by Phillips is that investors seem to have become more comfortable with the entire political and economic uncertainty in Europe. “18 months ago we received many questions and concerns regarding the ECB, will there be quantitative easing, will the Euro survive. Those concerns are less noticeable now and it appears many non-European investors have digested these issues and feel more comfortable with investing in Europe.”</p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter2-acrticle1"></a><h2>Estimate that CalPERS’ undisclosed PE payments over 18 years totaled ‘at least $5bn’</h2>
  <p class="text-info">A UK academic has been reported as saying that CalPERS, the largest US public pension scheme, “failed to disclose payments of at least $5bn to private equity managers over a period of 18 years”.</p>
  <p>The estimate was reported by the Financial Times on Monday, in an article which quoted Ludovic Phalippou, a finance professor at the University of Oxford Saïd Business School, who is said to specialise in private equity. According to the FT, Prof Phalippou estimated the undisclosed payments actually may total as much as $5.3bn, based on his calculation of “carried interest”, or investment profits, between 1990 and 2008.</p>
  <p>This figure “is in addition to the headline fees disclosed by CalPERS,” the FT went on, noting that the latest data it had suggested that CalPERS paid just under $440m to private equity managers in the year to the end of December, 2013. However, it said Prof Phalippou considered such data meaningless because it didn’t include the carried interest numbers. According to the FT, “the scale of the bill is likely to intensify pressure for a fundamental overhaul of reporting and disclosure standards of payments to private equity firms”.</p>
  <p>CalPERS, which manages pension assets of $300bn on behalf of California’s state employees, has already admitted it has not recorded its total payments to private equity managers since 1990, the FT pointed out. The issue of non-disclosure of private equity fees by CalPERS and certain other large pension funds surfaced earlier this summer, after California’s state treasurer voiced concern that some of these funds admitted not to knowing how much they had been paying their private equity fund managers for their services.</p>
  <p>In July, the FT said Calpers, which uses more than 100 private equity firms, had identified a need to track fees and carried interest better than it was currently in the habit of doing as far back as 2011, “but it has taken until now to develop a new reporting system for its $30.5bn private equity portfolio”. On Monday, the FT said that a working party is now to be established by the National Association of State Treasurers,  “to examine reporting and disclosure standards by private equity managers”.</p>
  <p>It is expected to provide a progress update in October, the FT said. Separately, the Los Angeles Times is quoting a top US economist as saying that CalPERS’ thus-far undisclosed private equity investing fees “are expected to be ‘ginormous'” when it finally reveals “how much it really pays Wall Street for its most rarefied services”, as it has “announced with some fanfare” in July that it will do.</p>
  <p>“All pension funds are going to be embarrassed when they have to reveal just how much they are actually paying private equity in performance fees,” Eileen Appelbaum, senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a Washington think tank, and author of Private Equity at Work: When Wall Street Manages Main Street, is quoted by the LA Times as saying. “And once CalPERS publishes what it has paid, it will be difficult for CalSTRS (California State Teachers’ Retirement System) and other pension funds to refuse to do so.</p>
  <p>“The amounts are going to be ginormous, and public officials are going to ask whether these payments … are warranted.” CalPERS is expected to release the final numbers in the autumn. The LA Times also quoted CalPERS’ chief operating investment officer, Wylie A Tollette, as acknowledging that the grand total of carried interest the firm has paid out from funds operating since 1998 is “going to be in the billions”.</p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter2-acrticle2"></a><h2>NYCRS boosts private equity emerging managers commitment to more than $14bn</h2>
  <p class="text-info">The New York City Retirement Systems has announced a $500m expansion to its private equity emerging managers programme, bringing the total amount invested or committed to it to more than $14bn.</p>
  <p>More than $11bn of that is invested or slated to back minority and women-owned business enterprises, a statement from New York City comptroller Scott Stringer said. He said, “This key expansion of our private equity emerging manager initiative will help us to build on the program’s early successes, and further expand opportunities for minority and women-owned investment firms.</p>
  <p>“We are always on the lookout for ways to expand the pool of investment managers who have the talent to grow our pension funds. Diversity is part of our fiduciary duty and I am confident that the New York City Pension Funds will benefit from the new thinking and new perspectives provided by these emerging managers and M/WBEs.”</p>
  <p>Last year, the comptroller announced the funds had approved a $1bn commitment to emerging managers across several asset classes. In May the comptroller and the funds launched a new initiative to incorporate diversity as a formal criteria in the selection of investment firms for the city’s $160bn funds, and proposed a formal graduation policy for emerging managers in public markets so that funds which no longer fit the exact definition of the asset class remain eligible for additional, targeted investment.</p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter2-acrticle3"></a><h2>Harvard offloads 50% of $1bn RE portfolio</h2>
  <p class="text-info">Harvard Management Company has reportedly sold half of the $1bn real estate secondaries it put on the block earlier this year, AltAssets understands.</p>
  <p>At this stage it is unclear which fund stakes have been sold or any details on pricing according to Secondaries Investor, which cited two sources familiar with the transactions. “They threw everything on the wall to see what would stick. They ended up selling only about $500 million,” one of the sources said. Back in March, AltAssets reported that HMC had placed $1bn of real estate fund interests up for sale as it looked to push into direct real estate investing. HMC, which manages Harvard University’s endowment and related financial assets, has a 12 per cent allocation to real estate this year.</p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter2-acrticle4"></a><h2>Florida sells up $1bn in fund interests</h2>
  <p class="text-info">US private equity firm Lexington Capital Partners has reportedly purchased between $500m and $1bn of fund interests from The State Board of Administration of Florida (SBAF).</p>
  <p>It was completed with the assistance of advisory firm Park Hill Group according to Secondaries Investor, which cited a spokesperson for the pension fund. The deal comes just days after Florida’s retirement system revealed more than $1.18bn of new commitments to private equity and real estate vehicles. SBAF dipped into the secondaries market back in March, by offloading a legacy portfolio valued at about $350m to Goldman Sachs Asset Management. Earlier this year, Lexington completed the final closing of its eighth vehicle at $10.1bn, making it the largest dedicated secondary fund ever raised.</p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter2-acrticle5"></a><h2>EIB commits €50m to €500m-targeting Impax renewable infra fund</h2>
  <p class="text-info">The European Investment Bank has revealed a €50m commitment to the latest infrastructure fund from Impax targeting renewable energy investments.</p>
  <p>Impax New Energy Investors III is eyeing up to €500m according to an investment document from the EIB, which reveals it approved the €50m backing towards the end of July. The fund primarily plans to invest in the construction of on-shore wind, solar and hydro projects across several European countries. Impax said it could not comment on the fundraise due to SEC marketing restrictions.</p>
  <p>The firm closed its second New Energy Investors fund on €330m in 2011, thanks to commitments from the EIB and unnamed UK pension funds. That fund was 75 per cent invested 12 months ago, the firm revealed at the time. Recent deals have included buying Finnish wind farm Kuolavaara-Keulakkopää from Fortum and Metsähallitus.</p>
  <p>This time last year the firm hired another three people to expand its private equity infrastructure team. Former Rochschild investment banker Babaola Omiyale joined as an investment manager, Lewis Haffey as a investment analyst and Aaron Donoghue as engineering and project operations consultant.</p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter2-acrticle6"></a><h2>PGGM announces ‘new guidelines’ on asset managers’ pay, remuneration and fees</h2>
  <p class="text-info">PGGM, the Dutch pension fund giant, has issued what it says are “new guidelines” setting out what it considers to be “acceptable remuneration” for asset management services, as a growing debate over fees paid by pension funds in the US begins to take root in other countries.</p>
  <p>
  A major financial publication in Australia recently reported that the Australian regulator is being urged to “clamp down on ‘ginormous’ private equity fees”, in the wake of recent US revelations and debate on the matter. In a two-page document posted on its website yesterday, signed by PGGM chief investment officer for private markets Ruulke Bagijn PGGM spells out its new stance on the remuneration of “external parties that we engage to manage part of the assets of pension funds”.
  </p>
  <p>The document, entitled “Remuneration in line with interests of capital provider”, begins by noting that the recent global financial crisis “raised a debate about the extent to which the financial system works in the interests of the pension funds: the capital providers”. “PGGM takes the side of these pension funds and their participants,” it continues. “Based on their interests, we have set new guidelines for acceptable remuneration of external parties that we engage to manage part of the assets of pension funds.”</p>
  <p>The statement links to PGGM’s official “Guideline for Compensation of Financial Services Providers”, which is dated 2 December 2014, and therefore is not noticeably new. But the statement continues by saying that “PGGM aims to achieve a number of things over time, such as: “Asset managers must be transparent regarding their pay and remuneration structures. Performance fees should only apply in the event of above-average performance that is agreed in advance. Only basic remuneration should be paid for the costs and pay of the management of the asset manager.</p>
  <p>While drafting guidelines such as these is not “simple”, the PGGM statement goes on, “dilemmas remain, such as, when we are able to realise exceptional returns but have to allow high fees to be paid in exchange for this, for example, with private equity. This is only acceptable if the pension fund fully benefits.” It then says: “Let’s be clear: The current market conditions in which PGGM operates are not the same as envisaged by PGGM. “We want to move to a situation in which financial services providers charge better rates and use restrained remuneration structures, so that they will act in the interests of our clients.</p>
  <p>“This is not something that can be achieved in the short term, and we realise that we also need this market in the meantime in order to generate returns for a decent pension.” The statement concludes by noting that PGGM is “expanding our own teams…to internalise investment management activities and thereby reduce costs.” Based in Zeist, near Utrecht, PGGM manages assets of around €186.6bn, on behalf of a number of clients, with the largest being the PFZW pension fund. A PGGM spokesman told AltAssets that Bagijn is away and that PGGM was therefore unable to make any further comment on the matter.</p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter2-acrticle7"></a><h2>GIC to capitalise on growing RE secondaries market by offloading portfolio</h2>
  <p class="text-info">The Government of Singapore Investment Corporation is reportedly looking to offload a large portfolio of real estate fund interests, which could value up to $1bn.</p>
  <p>GIC has hired Greenhill Cogent to run the sale, although the exact size of the portfolio hasn’t been revealed yet according to Secondaries Investor, which cited two people familiar with the matter. A recent report from Greenhill revealed that it had seen an accelerated evolution of the real estate secondary market. It estimates that global real estate secondary volume grew at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 25 per cent over the past four years, reaching $4bn in 2014. However with roughly $3bn of transaction volume already completed during the first half of the year months of 2015, Greenhill estimates that volume for the full year could more than double that achieved in 2014.</p>
  <p>Greenhill managing director Todd Miller said, “In our view this growth can be attributed to a combination of several variables, including a significant increase in dry powder dedicated to the real estate secondary space, years of pent-up supply, and attractive optical pricing relative to where this segment of the market traded just a few years ago.” Back in May, Landmark partner James Sunday told AltAssets that real estate secondary transactions are on the up, as LPs are becoming more comfortable selling large portfolios and GPs are embracing secondary capital to manage their portfolios.</p>

  <p>New York-based Welsh Carson, which specialises in investments in health care, information- and business-services companies, according to its website, launched the fund at the end of last year, the Securities & Exchange Commission filing reveals, with its first sale recorded on 19 December. Welsh Carson says its investment strategy is “deal-size agnostic, which allows [it] to invest in the most attractive risk-return opportunities identified in its two target industries”.

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter3-article2"></a><h2>TIAA-CREF raises $3bn for its second agriculture fund</h2>
  <p class="text-info">New York-based TIAA-CREF has raised $3bn for its second global agriculture fund, AltAssets understands.</p>
  <p>TIAA-CREF Global Agriculture II beat its initial target of $2.5bn, with the fund’s LPs including, AP2, Cummins UK Pension Plan Trustee, Environment Agency Pension Fund, Greater Manchester Pension Fund and New Mexico State Investment Council. The fund is significantly larger than TIAA-CREF’s previous agriculture fund, which closed at $2bn in May 2012, exceeding its $1.5bn target.
Back in August 2014, AltAssets reported that the firm had secured $1.4bn for the fund.</p>
  <p>Like its predecessor, the fund will focus on farmland assets in North America, South America and Australia. Jose Minaya, senior managing director and head of private markets asset management at TIAA-CREF Asset Management, said, “With its low correlation to traditional asset classes like stocks and bonds, farmland offers excellent portfolio diversification benefits for investors and a hedge against inflation.</p>
  <p>“The macroeconomic fundamentals for investing in farmland are very positive and we view the launch of this new strategy as a testament to the ongoing potential and attractiveness of this asset class.” New York-based TIAA-CREF and its subsidiary GreenWood Resources, formed Global TImber Resources, a $667m global timber company back in June.

  <p class="text-info">Morgan Stanley said on Wednesday that investors have committed around $1.7bn to North Haven Real Estate Fund VIII Global, its eighth and latest direct investment real estate fund.</p>
  <p>Olivier de Poulpiquet, co-chief executive officer and co-chief investment officer for Morgan Stanley Real Estate Investing (MSREI), said the now-closed “G8″ fund’s flexible, global mandate would enable it to be choosy about which markets it ultimately decides to invest in. It has already closed on transactions in the US, UK, Austria, Japan and Australia, de Poulpiquet noted. Investors in the fund include public and private pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, insurance companies and family offices and individuals, according to John Klopp, de Poulpiquet’s counterpart (co-CEO, co-CIO)  at MSREI.</p>
  <p>Morgan Stanley re-named its closed-end funds across private equity, real estate and credit earlier this year to North Haven, in response to the so-called Volcker Rule section of the Dodd-Frank Act, which mandates that banks not include their own name as part of the name for such funds.

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter3-article12"></a><h2>Existing investors push Hollyport close to £150m hard cap after just two months</h2>
  <p class="text-info">Hollyport Capital is closing in on its £150m target for its fifth dedicated secondaries fund after just two months.</p>
  <p>Hollyport Secondary Opportunities V has completed a first close of £125m with the majority coming from existing investors according chief executive John Carter. He told AltAssets, “Fundraising is always hard work and takes a lot of effort, but we have had a lot of support from our existing investors which inevitably makes it a lot easier. Carter added, “All of the LPs were European, by value the majority were institutional, but we still have a lot of family offices and high net worth individuals who have invested over a number of funds with us and continue to support us.”</p>
  <p>If the vehicle reaches its hard cap, it will not only be the firm’s latest to date, but it will be twice the size of its predecessor which closed on £75m back in 2013. After taking just two months to put the fund in touching distance of its hard cap, it seems that LP’s appetite for secondaries is as strong as ever. “I think that is a general statement which is probably true, I hesitate slightly because the secondary market is evolving and some institutional investors certainly feel that there is less value in the mainstream secondaries market now.</p>
  <p>“What I mean by that is if you look at the mainstream secondaries market, people are raising very substantial funds, in a highly competitive market. I think we benefited to a certain extent that we have a niche strategy that appeal to our investors. We focus on buying what we call legacy fund interests, so funds that are 10 years old or greater. So they are beyond their original intended term and there is an increasing number of these fund interests around.” Carter said that the main driver behind selling these assets is a house keeping exercise.</p>
  <p>“These remaining assets are very small for these institutions compared to their total exposure to the asset class. One of the challenges in the private equity industry is the value of assets in these old funds is going up year-on-year, and the reason for that is funds just don’t wrap up in 10 years and take up to 20 years to realise all their assets.</p>
  <p>“If you have been investing in the asset class for some time, you end up with all these little bits and pieces at the bottom of your portfolio, and we offer the opportunity to sell a completed basket of these fund interests in a simple straight forward cash transaction.” They said investors in the first close include entrepreneurs and C-level executives from the technology sector and other industries, high net worth and family office investors as well as private foundations.</p>

If the vehicle reaches its $150m target, its will still be significantly smaller than the $350m it pulled in for Fund IV back in July 2011.

  <p class="text-info">Hostplus, one of Australia’s largest superannuation funds, was one of the lead investors in QIC’s new Global Infrastructure Fund, which has marked its first close with commitments of A$1bn ($800m).</p>
  <p>QIC said this was more than half the A$1.75bn ($1.34bn) of total capital commitments it was targeting for the fund when it began fund-raising efforts around four months ago. Other investors in the fund have included an Asian sovereign wealth fund, one of China’s leading insurers, and two foundation QIC clients, QIC said in a statement on Monday. An additional commitment has also been made under a co-investment arrangement, QIC said.</p>
  <p>The announcement of the fund’s first close means that the fund’s investment period has now begun, and the fund will be in a position to deploy capital. QGIF is an unlisted investment vehicle that QIC, one of Australia’s largest institutional investment managers, says will “seek to provide institutional investors with access to attractive, risk-adjusted returns, through long-term exposure to a diversified portfolio of global infrastructure assets”.</p>
  <p>QIC Global Infrastructure head Ross Israel said “focused marketing efforts and a strong potential investment pipeline” had helped to secure the support of the investors in the new global infra fund. Hostplus is the pension fund of more than one million Australians who work or have worked in that country’s hospitality, tourism, recreation and sports industries. It has more than A$18bn in assets under management, according to its website.</p>

It said the new fund will be managed by the same team executing the same investment strategy that has delivered solid results over the past nine years.</p>
  <p>QIC currently has around A$73.8bn ($56.9bn) in assets under management, offering infrastructure, real estate, private equity, liquid strategies and multi-asset investment services.

  <p>As reported earlier this year, QIC recently announced it had joined forces with the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (“CalPERS”) to create an A$1bn Asia-Pacific infrastructure partnership. Last month, as AltAssets also reported, an Australian financial publication reported that certain politicians in the Australian state of Queensland – where QIC is located – were talking about ways QIC might be “force to reduce its international and cash exposure, to allocate more funds to the State’s infrastructure”.

  <p>Guilherme Ferreira, a senior partner at Jive, said the company – a distressed credit investment specialist – has now closed the Jive Distressed fund, as it had reached its hard cap of 500m reais ($145m). “The fund starts with about 120m reais invested in Jive’s legacy portfolios,” Ferreira added. He said Jive’s investment team has until January 2018 to deploy the fund.</p>
  <p>Clients of Credit Suisse Hedging-Griffo, the Swiss bank’s private-banking unit in Brazil, accounted for most of the 500m reais raised for the Jive fund, according to Ferreira, as its clients sought to diversify their portfolios in response to Brazil’s currently gloomy economic climate.  A recent report by the Reuters news service noted that as inflation erodes disposable income in Brazil, and households are defaulting on their loans at the fastest pace in six years, “appetite for problematic property, defaulted loans and other distressed assets” there is surging.</p>
