  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter1-article1"></a><h2>Choppy political, economic environment in North Africa fails to dim PE appetite</h2>
  <p class="text-info">A tricky political and economic environment in North Africa has not affected the stability of private equity dealmaking in the region, new research suggests.</p>
  <p>Buyout firms’ continued appetite for investments in the area saw the region retain its 15 per cent share of private equity deal volume across all of Africa between 2007 and 2014, the Africa Private Equity and Venture Capital Association said in its Spotlight on North Africa Private Equity report. The research reported 156 PE deals in North Africa in the time period, carrying a reported value of $5.3bn and a median deal size of $10m.</p>
  <p>Morocco, Egypt and Tunisia attracted the lion’s share of North African deals, accounting for almost 90 per cent of all deals in the region by volume and value, with Morocco taking the single greatest share (39 per cent) of deal numbers. AVCA chief executive Michelle Kathryn Essomé said, “North Africa is resilient as evidenced by PE investment activity in recent years as PE firms are leveraging their skills, networks and resources to identify and execute value creation strategies in portfolio companies.”</p>
  <p>Ponmile Osibo, research analyst at AVCA, added, “Deal volumes in North Africa have remained stable in recent years because of local PE firms’ continued appetite to invest in businesses, and the ability of small and medium-sized enterprises to successfully identify new export markets.</p>
  <p>“We see this level of deal activity as continuing. In addition, North African countries are enacting various reforms to stimulate economic growth and stabilise the political environment, while the recent fall in oil prices is further enabling non-oil exporting countries, such as Egypt and Tunisia, to improve trade balances – all of which will add further confidence to PE investors in the region.”</p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter1-article2"></a><h2>Israel sees record-breaking high-tech investment despite slump in VC backing</h2>
  <p class="text-info">Israeli high-tech companies raised a record $1.12bn in the second quarter of this year despite a fall in the proportion of capital coming from venture capital sources.</p>
  <p>VC-backed deals shrank to 44 per cent, down from a 75 per cent quarterly average over the past six years according to the latest IVC-KPMG research. The record high exceeded the $1.11bn invested in the fourth quarter of last year, and a 12 per cent rise on the $997m raised last quarter. In the first half of 2015, 342 Israeli high-tech companies attracted $2.1bn, compared to the $1.6bn raised by 334 companies in H1/2014, and the $878m invested in 307 companies in H1/2013.</p>
  <p>Ofer Sela, a partner at KPMG Somekh Chaikin’s technology group, said, “Fifty percent of the amount raised during this quarter, and even more since the beginning of 2015, results from large deals of $20m or more raised per round. “The overall number of growth companies attracting investments continues to increase quarter over quarter, reflecting the health of the venture-backed ecosystem in Israel and the patience of investors supporting their portfolio companies to complete homeruns and grow into ‘unicorns’ that are substantial and mature.”</p>
  <p>The average VC-backed deal dropped to $4.9m, compared with the previous quarter’s record of $9.1m, back to the Q2/2014 level, which stood at $5m. IVC-KPMG’s analysis revealed that foreign private equity funds and corporate investors were responsible for $477m or nearly 43 per cent of the total investments in Q2/2015. IVC Research Center CEO Koby Simana said, “Most of the increase in capital raising in the second quarter can be attributed to two exceptionally large deals, where private equity funds invested in growth-stage companies.</p>
  <p>“Moreover, an investor profile analysis we conducted shows an impressive increase in the number of foreign private equity funds investing directly in Israeli technology companies – i.e., in deals where the equity capital is placed directly in the company, rather than shareholder equity changing hands.” Simana believes that the interest shown by private equity investors in growth stage companies is yet another indicator of the Israeli technology- and venture capital industry’s evolvement and maturity.</p>
  <p>“If we want the local high-tech industry to continue growing and see more large-scale, mature companies emerge, there is room for technology investments from more than just VC funds – local or foreign. “The industry needs a variety of investors and investment models to support companies throughout various stages.</p>
  <p>“Private equity funds and international conglomerates are the kind of investors we want to see supporting growth companies, and we have lately found that, indeed, the number of growth stage technology companies in Israel is rapidly increasing.“As the number of high growth companies and company valuations climb even further, we expect to see a more diverse investor mix.”</p> 

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter1-article3"></a><h2>ABRY, HIG most sought-after US mid-market secondaries managers</h2>
  <p class="text-info">ABRY Partners and HIG Capital topped a ranking of the35 most sought-after US mid-market buyout managers in the secondaries market in Q2 according to Setter Capital. </p>
  <p>According to a list by Toronto-based advisory firm Setter Capital, the private equity duo were joined by Friedman Fleischer & Lowe, Genstar and JLL Partners at the top. While Weston Presidio, Cressey & Co and KRG made it in the rankings at the bottom of the list. The report is based on the Setter Liquidity Rating which rates fund families as excellent, very good, good and unrated depending on how sought-after and saleable they are on the secondary market.</p>
  <p>It found that the funds of most sought-after manager’s price on average about 9 per cent better than funds of unrated managers, Setter noted. Those popular funds have typically performed better, with an average internal rate of return of 16 per cent, than those of unrated managers, which have an average IRR of 14 per cent. The most sought after also raised more money, with their average fund size being $1.5bn compared to $684m for unrated managers.</p>
  <p>Additionally, there is significantly more buyer demand for the most sought after managers, with the average number of prime buyers being 25, versus four for the unrated managers. Setter senior analyst Kristina Kulikova told AltAssets, “Sometimes when there is a lot of competition on certain funds/managers, certain buyers will step aside ‎and say they are less likely to be competitive, since there is likely to be a feeding frenzy.</p>
  <p>“On the other hand, you have new buyers looking to the buying interests of the larger fund of funds and secondary funds due to their experience hence seeing which managers are most in demand serves as a helpful guideline.”</p>
  <p>Last month, AltAssets reported that Blackstone Capital Partners, Apollo Investment Fund and Bain Capital are the most sought-after US large-cap buyout managers on the secondary market according to the Setter Most Sought After list. Kulikova added that portfolio rebalancing and reducing the number of GP relationship are still the main motivates for the sellers.</p>
  <p>“We see a lot of Secondary funds (who are typically on the buying end of the spectrum) looking to sell their higher multiple funds where they feel there isn’t much further upward movement for the NAV, despite the remaining term. “So the way they look at it is: if the GP is projecting a certain NAV that the fund is likely to end up at, and they feel it has already hit that level, it makes sense to sell and not have the money sitting there for the rest of the remaining term since they can re-invest that capital.</p>
  <p>“There is also still obviously a manager– relationship consideration, where if the group is no longer planning to re-up with the manager g‎oing forward they may look to sell to clean up relationships that they have.” UK private equity market can be found in the next edition of Limited Partner magazine, due out at the start of July.</p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter1-article4"></a><h2>CenterSquare Investment’s P.J. Yeatman shares his thoughts on buying property now</h2>
  <p class="text-info">P.J. Yeatman’s strategy for buying property in the US right now, on behalf of CenterSquare, BNY Mellon’s real assets investment boutique, is simple. “We like to focus on primary assets in secondary markets, and on secondary assets in primary markets,” the Philadelphia-based property expert, pictured, explains. </p>
  <p>“What that means is this:  If you look at the universe of 32 US cities which are home to National Football league teams, you are looking at a proxy for a universe of US cities that are not ‘tertiary’ and which therefore are theoretically investible to us, because they are either primary, secondary or even lower-secondary markets.</p>
  <p>“But today, in ‘primary’ markets like New York and San Francisco, I don’t believe you can buy primary assets at values that make economic sense. So therefore, if we’re buying in these kinds of gateway markets, we want to buy ‘secondary assets’ that are on the fringe of up-and-coming areas, and thus can benefit from the rental compression that happens in these markets, as demand gets intense for space.</p>
  <p>“Conversely, when we are thinking about secondary markets – and there are some wonderful secondary markets in our country, in the form of Nashville, and Portand Oregon, and Austin Texas, for example – what is important to remember when investing is that you own the best, or ‘primary’, real estate.</p>
  <p>“Because when the next downturn comes around – and there will always be a ‘next downturn’, it’s only a question of when – in secondary markets, which are the first to lose liquidity, it’s very important that you’re holding the best real estate in town, so you can exit your investments without having to take a discount.”</p>
  <p>Yeatman, who heads up the CenterSquare’s private equity real estate division, spoke with AltAssets last week about his and CenterSquare’s buying strategy, in the wake of the $100m first close, earlier this year, of CenterSquare’s third value-added fund. CenterSquare was originally founded in 1987 in Philadelphia by E Scott Urdang, and in 2006 was acquired by the Bank of New York Co., which later merged with Mellon Financial Corp. It kept the Urdang name until 2013, when it was rebranded as CenterSquare, and it now manages about $8bn in assets.</p>
  <p>Yeatman describes his preferred investment strategy as a contrarian one, occasionally informed by educated observations about the marketplace, and insight as to how currently-unloved assets can be significantly re-positioned at a reasonable cost, generating exceptional value for CenterSquare’s investors in the process.</p>
  <p>“We think of ourselves as middle-market, special situation buyers of ‘transitional assets’,” Yeatman says, explaining this approach. “In other words, we are always in the market for assets that need significant repositioning. “What has changed a little bit recently is that you now have a tremendous amount of competition in the true middle market, or upper-middle market, area, that space where people are investing $25m to $50m of equity in each transaction.</p>
  <p>“As a result, where we’re seeing really interesting opportunities are among the smaller assets, as small as $7m of equity to $15m of equity. “The assets may be smaller, but the profits are larger.” The incredible shrinking American car park One of the most interesting elements of Yeatman’s investment philosophy concerns parking spaces for the cars people use to drive themselves to work – which, he explains, matter hugely in America’s towns and cities, as these are significantly less-well served by trains and other forms of public transport than urban and suburban areas in most other parts of the world.</p>
  <p>The reason they matter so much, according to Yeatman, is because companies across the US have reduced by roughly  half the amount of office space they allot to each employee,  with the result that “parking lots” designed to accommodate the cars driven by those working in buildings built even as recently as the Eighties and Nineties are turning out to be significantly inadequate.</p>
  <p>“Corporate America has declared that greater efficiency is needed, and so they are now shoe-horning people into 125 sq ft of space per person, down from about 250 sq feet per person in the 1980s and 1990s,” Yeatman explains. “I’ve even seen densities as high as 80 sq ft per person.</p>
  <p>“If you double the occupancy of a building, you need to double the occupancy of the parking field; but most of these suburban office properties are confined by the other properties that border them, and they can’t simply expand laterally. But to build a garage or a deck would be extremely expensive.“So a lot of these office buildings are almost physically obsolete, unless you can find a solution to the parking problem.”</p>
  <p>Recently CenterSquare was able to come up with a particularly good and low-cost solution to such a “parking challenged” office building in a Dallas suburb, according to Yeatman, which happened to come with an adjacent, 130,000 sq ft industrial property, of no significant value. “We converted the industrial building to covered, climate-controlled parking, and within seven months of buying the asset we signed a lease on the entire 200,000 sq ft property with a single tenant, even though we hadn’t even done it up yet, at a rate that was incredibly accretive to the investment.”</p>
  <p>Another investment parable that Yeatman says he inculcates in his team is to look for property sellers who are “asset rich and cash poor” – as opposed to being, he says, the sort of sellers who “wake up every morning thinking about how they’re going to maximise the value of their property”. Particularly good investments in this asset-rich/cash-poor category can be found among distressed retailers, according to Yeatman. “A&P, for example, just filed for bankruptcy, for the second time in five years,” he adds. “We will be very interested in discussing their surplus real estate with them.”</p>

  <p class="text-info">The $181bn-managing Florida State Board of Administration has revealed more than $1.18bn of new commitments to private equity and real estate vehicles, it has emerged.</p>
  <p>FSBA pledged close to $750m to private equity vehicles according to communications manager John Kuczwanksi, who revealed the commitments in an email to Pensions & Investments. Blackstone’s $15bn-targeting Capital Partners VII fund was the big winner, picking up $180m, while UK-based Montagu Private Equity could receive up to £100m for its fifth flagship vehicle.</p>
  <p>Other recipients of commitments included Waterland Private Equity Fund VI, Thoma Bravo Special Oppoortunities Fund II, Insight Venture Partners Growth Buyout Co-Investment Fund, and fund of funds RCP X. In distressed debt, Oaktree Capital received a commitment of $200m towards its Oaktree Opportunities Fund Xb, while Castlelake IV received $95m.</p>
  <p>Blackstone bagged another commitment on the real estate side through a $100m pledge to its Real Estate Partners VIII fund, while Heitman Value Partners could receive $50m. The FSBA committed around $674m to private equity funds during Q1, including to TPG Capital. </p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter2-article2"></a><h2>17Capital ups stake in Hutton Collins III</h2>
  <p class="text-info">London-based 17Capital has upped its stake in a Hutton Collins Partners-managed fund, AltAssets understands.</p>
  <p>17Capital bought a stake in Hutton Collins Capital Partners III from BNP Paribas Capital Partners’ Fundexi Europe II according to a filing in the Gazette. The 2009-vintage Hutton Collins Fund III is a $600m vehicle which focuses on mezzanine and debt financing according to its website. Back in July last year, AltAssets reported that Hutton was looking to offload stakes in the fund.</p>
  <p>At the time a Hutton Collins spokesman said, “The effort has been initiated by the manager as a number of existing limited partners no longer participate in the asset class and might therefore seek to achieve early liquidity.” 17Capital previously purchased a stake in the same fund in March directly from the funds manger according to separate filing. While Japan’s Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire Insurance also sold a stake in the Hutton Collins fund to the manager itself in June.</p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter2-article3"></a><h2>HarbourVest buys stake in Portobello’s second fund</h2>
  <p class="text-info">HarbourVest Partners has reportedly purchased a stake in a fund managed by Spanish private equity firm Portobello Capital, AltAssets understands.</p>
  <p>As a part of the deal, Portobello would transfer assets in the fund to a new structure with new terms according to Secondaries investor, which cited a source familiar with the matter. The transaction, which was a GP-led whole fund liquidity transaction, enabled Madrid-based Portobello to return capital to investors, the source added.
Some existing limited partners have chosen to roll over into the new fund with new terms.The fund, Portobello Capital II, closed in July 2006 on €331m and currently holds seven companies, including seafood product maker Angulas Aguinaga and insurance services firm Multiasistencia according to its website. Last year, Portobello Capital sealed a €375m final close for its third fund making it the largest fund raised in the country.

  <p class="text-info">The European Investment Bank (EIB) has made its first equity participation in France under the Investment Plan for Europe, by backing an investment fund managed by Omnes Capital.</p>
  <p>A day after the EIB Group signed an agreement with the European Commission to implement the Investment Plan for Europe (the Juncker Plan), it completed a €50m commitment to renewable energies vehicle Capenergie 3. With a target size of €200m, the Capenergie 3 fund will leverage total investment of €1bn and will focus on European renewable energy production infrastructure projects. EIB vice-president Ambroise Fayolle said, “The EIB is mobilising more than ever to ensure the successful implementation of the Investment Plan for Europe in France. </p>
  <p>Our first equity participation in this fund has a twofold objective: to ensure the success of Capenergie 3’s first fund-raising while attracting other European and global investors. The growing competitiveness of renewable energies creates new investment opportunities that must be seized. Rapid and targeted action is the key to achieving the lasting return of growth through investment.” </p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter3-article1"></a><h2>ArcLight Capital beats target with sixth Energy Partners fund, at $5.6bn</h2>
  <p class="text-info">Boston-based ArcLight Capital Partners  has closed its sixth Energy Partners fund on $5.575bn, beating its $4bn target.</p>
  <p>ArcLight announced the closing in a statement on Wednesday. It didn’t reveal the identities of the fund’s limited partners. Investors in the previous fund included Maine Public Employees Retirement System, Colorado PERA and Montana Board of Investments.</p>
  <p>Last week, AltAssets reported that the private equity and venture capital firm, which specialises in buyout and growth capital investments in the energy and infrastructure sectors, had filed an update on the funding round with the US Securities & Exchange Commission which showed that sales of its $4bn-targeting Energy Partners Fund VI had reached a little more than $5.266bn, from some 203 investors.</p>
  <p>The fund’s initial hard cap had been $5bn. ArcLight began raising the capital towards the end of last year. ArcLight Energy Partners VI will focus on the North American energy infrastructure sector, including investment opportunities in pipelines, storage facilities, oil and gas terminals, electric transmission facilities and businesses involved in the production of oil and natural gas.</p>
  <p>ArcLight’s previous fund closed in 2011 with $3.3bn of commitments, and went on to post an average IRR of 11.53 per cent and an average multiple of 1.18x as of December 31, 2014, according to published reports. The company says it has now raised more than $15bn globally since it was founded in 2001. ArcLight’s leadership team includes managing partner and co-founder Daniel Revers, and senior partner and co-founder Robb Turner.</p>
  <p>Rivers said the timing of ArcLight’s latest fund coincided with a “once-in-a-generation transformation” in the North American energy market that was bringing “unprecedented change across the entire energy complex”. “We believe the insights, networks, and resources we’ve developed over the past 15 years across diverse market cycles will help ArcLight Fund VI take advantage of a particularly exciting and complex environment,” he added.</p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter3-article2"></a><h2>Sterling raises its largest fund to date after 3 months on the road</h2>
  <p class="text-info">Texas-based private equity firm Sterling Group has raised $1.25bn for its fourth fund, making it its largest fund to date, after just three months of fundraising.</p>
  <p>The firm was able to raise the fund quickly due to support from existing LPs, with demand outweighing the supply according to Buyouts, which cited partner Kevin Garland. Last month, AltAssets reported that the firm had set a $1.25bn target for the vehicle, with the $8.1bn-managing Arizona Public Safety Personnel Retirement System committing to the fund. Fund IV comes five years since the closing on Sterling Group Partners III, which closed on $820m and generated a 23.5 per cent IRR as of December 31 for the Wisconsin Investment Board, according to performance data compiled by Bison.</p>
  <p>LPs in Fund III include CPPIB and Sacramento Private Equity Partners, an account for the California Public Employees’ Retirement System managed by Oak Hill Capital Partners, although it is unclear at this stage whether any of the previous have re-upped. Despite being 50 per cent larger than its predecessor, Fund IV will keep deals to about the same size, however it may end up closing more platform acquisitions.</p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter3-article3"></a><h2>Accel-KKR looks to raise over $1bn for new fund</h2>
  <p class="text-info">Technology-focused private equity firm Accel-KKR is back on the fundraising trail with a new fund targeting more than $1bn, AltAssets can reveal.</p>
  <p>Accel-KKR Capital Partners V has launched with a $1.2bn target but has yet to receive any commitments according to a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, the firm is also looking to raise $170m via Accel-KKR Capital Partners V Strategic Fund, which looks to be a side vehicle to main fund. Accel- KKR was unavailable to comment.</p>
  <p>If the fund reaches its target it will outstrip the $750m the firm pulled in for Accel-KKR Capital Partners IV back in 2012. Back in April 2012, the firm exceeded its hard cap for its fourth fund after closing the vehicle with commitments of $750m.  Founded in 2000, Accel-KKR is a partnership between private equity heavyweight KKR and venture capital major Accel Partners.</p>
  <p>With $2.5bn of capital under management, Accel-KKR looks to invest in the lower mid-market software and technology-enabled services companies according to its website. In March last year, the buyout house exceeded its target for its second Structured Capital Partners fund by pulling in $325m of commitments from LPs.</p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter3-article4"></a><h2>Searchlight pushes past $850m mark for Fund II</h2>
  <p class="text-info">Private equity firm Searchlight Capital Partners looks to have held a first close of over $850m for its second fund.</p>
  <p>Searchlight Capital II has landed $82m from eight investors according a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. While related vehicle, Searchlight Capital II PV, has pulled in $769.6m from 21 LPs according to a separate filing. It is not clear whether the fund has a completed a first close, although the filing does indicate that Park Hill Group has been brought in to push the vehicle to LPs. Earlier this month, the firm was reportedly nearing a final closed of $1bn according to Thomson Reuters, which cited a person with knowledge of the fundraising.</p>
  <p>The targeted amount is yet to be officially disclosed, however in February, AltAssets reported that the firm was looking to raise up to $1.5bn for its second fund, almost double the $860m it gathered for its 2012 debut. Searchlight declined to comment on the fundraising due to regulatory reasons. The firm invests in both the equity and debt of attractive companies across a wide range of industries according to its website. </p>

  <p class="text-info">Healthcare-focused investment firm Deerfield Management Company has held a $550m final close for its healthcare innovations venture fund.</p>
  <p>Deerfield hopes to use the fund to back ground-breaking advances in science which could lead to therapeutic interventions in genetic diseases, cancer, and orphan diseases. It said it would also back new technologies to transform how therapeutics are developed and improve the way healthcare is delivered to patients. Investors in the vehicle included prominent healthcare institutions such as New York-Presbyterian Hospital, Memorial Sloan Kettering and Seattle Children’s Hospital, and philanthropies, such as the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.</p>
  <p>Leading universities with cutting-edge research, such as Princeton University and Northwestern University, are also among the investor group. Deerfield was previously in the fundraising market as recently as last April, when it held a $1.6bn final close for its third flagship fund. That vehicle has been targeting areas of the healthcare industry including biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, medical devices, healthcare services, and animal health.</p>
  <p>Deerfield president and managing partner James Flynn said, “The unprecedented advances in our understanding of the biology of disease combined with the application of new technologies allow for life-altering changes in medical practice. “The pullback in funding that has occurred for these innovations over the last decade could not have happened at a worse time.”</p>

  <p class="text-info">Healthcare-focused growth equity firm Foresite Capital has raised $450m for its oversubscribed third fund, making it the largest fund raised by the firm.</p>
  <p>The closing of Foresite Capital Fund III takes the firm’s assets under management to $1bn. Fund II comes just over a year since the firm closed Foresite Capital Fund III, a $300m fund which closed a year after its $100m predecessor. Like its prior funds, Foresite Capital Fund III will look to invest in novel products, technologies and services that have the potential to significantly improve patient outcomes while decreasing the cost and burden of human disease.</p>
  <p>Foresite founder and CEO Jim Tananbaum said, “We are grateful for the strong interest from our existing and new investors, and the continued support of our investment approach from both investors and entrepreneurs. “We believe the healthcare landscape will continue to transform over the next decade and we remain focused on concentrating our human and financial resources on leading entrepreneurs with transformative products.”</p>

  <p class="text-info">Silversmith Capital Partners, the Boston growth equity firm founded earlier this year by two former Bain Capital Ventures execs, has confirmed it could gather up to $450m for its debut fund.</p>

It shows that Monument Group is acting as a placement agent for Silversmith Capital Partners I, which is split into a trio of related vehicles.</p>
  <p>Silversmith Capital Partners I will invest in lower middle market companies in the technology and healthcare sectors according to a report earlier this month from Buyouts, which cited a document from the University of Michigan Board of Regents.

  <p>General partners Fabio Banducci and Randy Garg provided 10 per cent of the capital for the debt and equity vehicle according to a statement from the Canadian firm. Banducci said, “We fill the financing gap between where banks leave off for higher-growth technology companies, and where traditional venture capital, private equity or the public equity markets typically look to play.</p>
  <p>“With creative and flexible debt-oriented solutions, we can support the growth-capital needs of companies with far less dilution than equity-only financings, or in some cases, help companies avoid selling too early when growth capital simply isn’t available to them.” Vistara – Sanskrit for ‘expansion’ – plans to provide growth capital to technology and technology-enabled services companies generating $10m to $200m in revenue located across Canada and the western US.  The fund will invest between $5m and $15m per company, with potential co-investments available alongside its LPs. </p>
  <p>Banducci was most recently CEO of Peer 1 Hosting, where he led its turnaround and growth over eight-and-a-half years to its $650m exit in 2013.  Garg was a managing partner of a family office investment fund, where he directly led and managed investments of more than $80m over the last four-and-a-half years, primarily in the technology sector. They said investors in the first close include entrepreneurs and C-level executives from the technology sector and other industries, high net worth and family office investors as well as private foundations.</p>

  <p class="text-info">GSR Capital, a China-based, tech-focused investment firm, announced on Monday that it is launching a $5bn fund to invest in global industrial and technology companies.</p>
  <p>In a statement, the company said it is targeting “cross-border buyouts and M&A of industrial and emerging technology companies, with multi-billion dollar scaling opportunities in China”.</p>
  <p>The new fund will be managed by GSR GO Scale Capital Advisor, which currently manages GSR’s existing GSR GO Scale Capital Growth Fund, and which will “work closely” with Good Resources Holdings, a Hong Kong listed, Bermuda-based investment company, GSR said.</p>
  <p>GSR Capital came to the attention of many private equity and venture capital market players back in April, when it was among a group of investors that teamed up to buy a lighting component unit of Philips for $2.8bn, surprising a number of well-established private equity firms that had also been in the bidding.</p>
  <p>With offices in Hong Kong, Beijing and Palo Alto, California, GSR Capital claims to be “one of the most active technology investment firms in China”, and says it focuses in particular on the “wireless internet, clean energy, semiconductors, and pharmaceutics and healthcare” sectors. It says it currently administers investments in its existing funds of more than $2bn.</p>
  <p> In a recent interview with the Reuters news agency, GSR co-founder and chairman Sonny Wu said that although “growth now in the US, in Europe and in Asia is soft”, some sectors remain “hot, primarily in the technology space”. The new, $5bn-targeting GSR Global M&A Fund is to be “anchored” by GSR with $1bn from its own GSR GO Scale Capital Limited Partners fund and unnamed institutional investors, the company said.</p>
  <p>The GSR fundraising was announced on a day when the Shanghai stock exchange saw its biggest one-day fall in more than eight years, as investors failed to be convinced that the Chinese authorities would do enough to keep the markets stable, in spite of recent, extensive measures employed in recent weeks.</p>
  <p>By the close of trading, the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index had dropped by 8.5 per cent, and two thirds of the exchange’s listed companies had been suspended from trading after reaching the daily downside limit of 10 per cent. The fall came after earlier falls that saw more than $3trn wiped off the value of China’s listed companies.</p>

  <p class="text-info">Golden Gate Ventures, a Southeast Asia-based investment house focused on forging ties between Silicon Valley and Asia, said it has completed a first-closed for its second fund on $35m – with contributions from Temasek, the Singapore fund, and Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin.</p>
  <p>Also participating in the round were Monitor Capital Partners, a European multi-family office; Singapore’s National Research Foundation, NAVER; and Far East Ventures, the venture capital arm of Far East Organization, one of the largest property developers in Southeast Asia. Golden Gate said it is targeting $50m with its “early-stage venture capital fund”. Separately, Golden Gate Ventures said it had released its first-ever research report comparing investment trends in Southeast Asia to those of China and India.</p>
  <p>Vinnie Lauria, managing partner of Golden Gate Ventures, pictured, explained his investment team’s thinking with respect to Southeast Asian tech start-ups currently. “If you’re looking to invest in Asia, China’s not only overpriced, but it’s starting to cool down,” he said. “Earlier this month the Chinese Securities Regulatory Commission went so far as to put a moratorium on tech IPOs, an action that has since stunted as many as 28 IPOs. “Meanwhile, Southeast Asia has explosive growth in development, and investment at much lower valuations – it’s like going back in time and getting in on the ground floor of China’s tech scene.”</p>
  <p>Since it was founded in 2011, Golden Gate Ventures has invested in more than 25 companies across seven  countries in Asia. It says its portfolio of companies has created more than 500 new jobs in the region and is projected to generate more than $60n in revenue this year.</p>
  <p>Golden Gate Ventures was founded by three individuals with previous entrepreneurial experience: Lauria, who co-founded two Silicon Valley startups, including Lefora forum hosting, which was acquired in 2010; Jeffrey Paine, who spent more than a decade of managing investments in Asia and helped to launch numerous companies; and Paul Bragiel, who remains an investor and/or adviser in some 33Silicon Valley companies, including Uber, and previously also was involved in the founding of three global tech companies.</p>
  <p>Golden Gate Ventures is headquartered in Singapore. In a story on its website today, headlined “Singapore ramps up efforts to achieve digital ambitions”, the Financial Times reports on Singapore’s efforts to become “an Asian version of Silicon Valley”. While China and India attract more dollars, the FT points out, “Singapore offers a strong legal system and minimal red tape — a business can be set up online in 15 minutes — making it a logical base from which to access bigger regional markets that lack these advantages”.</p>
  <p>The challenge, some observers say, is a dearth of creative ideas, the FT adds, and it also quotes one source as saying that exiting investments can be a struggle as there are few big Alibaba-, Google- or Facebook-style companies ready to snap up the next big thing. </p>
