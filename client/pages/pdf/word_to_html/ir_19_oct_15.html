  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter1-article1"></a><h2>Indian summer for PE dealmaking as September brings $42.2bn of transactions</h2>
    <p class="text-info">Private equity’s surprisingly strong summer dealmaking continues through September with another $42.2bn of transactions, new research shows.</p>
  <p>That total across 579 deals was slightly down on impressive August figures of $45.3bn according to data from Zephyr published by BvD, but well ahead of the $38.8bn recorded for September 2014. It said the US was once again the primary driver of PE dealmaking in the month under review, although the $21.8bn invested in the country still represented a decline on the USD $25.6bn invested there in August.</p>
  <p>US online automotive insurance player Solera Holdings was targeted in September’s top private equity deal by value, as Goldman Sachs, Vista Equity and Koch Equity Development offered to buy the firm for $6.5bn. That deal alone represented 15 per cent of total PE investment during September. The number two deal came close behind in terms of value, as Tesco agreed to sell its Homeplus operations in South Korea to a consortium led by MBK Partners for $6.4bn. </p>
  <p>That deal has been given the go ahead by the Fair Trade Commission and is expected to close on October 22. Of the top ten transactions announced in September, seven targeted US companies in a range of sectors including real estate investment, software and vehicle lighting. South Korea placed second by value behind the US for the month thanks to the MBK Tesco deal. The US was also the most frequently targeted country, with 215 deals in September, followed by China and the UK with 73 and 46 respectively.</p>
  <p>PE investment in the publishing and printing sector led the way again in September, although in line with the overall pattern, value for the industry actually declined on August. In all some USD 8,128 million was invested in September, compared to USD 11,277 million in August. However, the result marks a significant increase on the USD 555 million injected in September 2014.</p>
  <p>Other high-performing sectors include wholesale and retail trade, which was targeted in deals worth $7,496m, and banks, which brought in investment of $7,470m. In keeping with the overall global PE trend, volume increased in many sectors in September. The top 11 industries all increased or remained level month-on-month and only a few exceptions were noted, including construction, hotels and restaurants, wood, cork and paper and post and telecommunications. </p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter1-article2"></a><h2>Year-on-year PE, VC biotech investment jumps despite monthly slide </h2>
    <p class="text-info">The value of private equity, venture capital and development capital investment targeting global biotechnology companies was up more than a third year-on-year in September despite a month-on-month drop.</p>
  <p>The slump to $334m from August’s mammoth $3.7bn was largely down to a single deal, however, and volume was actually up by about a third compared to the previous month. Year-on-year, value was 35 per cent higher than the $248m-worth of investment recorded in September 2014, the latest research from Zephyr published by BvD showed. Individual transaction valuations in September were still low in comparison to August, however, with none exceeding $100m in value in the four weeks under review.</p>
  <p>The majority of the top 20 PE, VC and DC transactions by value targeting global biotech companies in September were funding rounds and minority stake investments, Zephyr said. The largest was a $70 million series B round for US gene editing-focused company Intellia Therapeutics, led by OrbiMed Healthcare and including Fidelity Management and Research, Janus Capital and Foresite Capital, among others.</p>
  <p>There was one buyout in the top 20 deals by value, in which Swedish PE firm Ratos agreed to acquire a 60 per cent stake in TFS Trial Form Support International, a clinical contract research services provider, for $30m. While US-based biotech companies were predominantly targeted in the top 20 deals by value in September, firms based in Sweden, the UK, Belgium, China, France, South Korea and Australia were also targeted.</p>
  <p>Investment value targeting US biotech up on a year ago. A total of $244m was invested in US biotech companies in September, a 38 per cent decrease on $393m in August, but a three-fold increase on $76m 12 months ago. Sweden was elevated to second in the rankings by value thanks to the Ratos deal, marking the country’s best result of the last 12 months. </p>
  <p>Investment in UK biotech companies also advanced over the four weeks to $23m from $15m, and was triple the $7m recorded at the same time last year, ranking the country third by value in September. The US led by volume with 11 transactions in September, unchanged from the previous month and fractionally lower than the 12 deals announced in September 2014. The UK was second with three transactions, a slight decrease on four in August, but better than the single transaction recorded 12 months previously.  </p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter1-article3"></a><h2>“Market correction” due for private equity industry amid pre-crisis similarities </h2>
    <p class="text-info">The increasingly hot private equity market is showing strong similarities to the pre-financial crisis industry and a “market correction” is due, M&G investment management senior associate Vivian Lu has told AltAssets.</p>
  <p>She said, “I am not really saying that a crisis is coming for sure but there are some similarities in what is happening now in the private equity market and what was happening pre-crisis. “The general environment is looking very similar to what we have seen before the last crisis in terms of fundraising and investment activity as well as the valuations. There is more fundraising activity as well as bigger size funds.</p>
  <p>“The market is getting hotter. This and greater demand from LPs, especially private LPs, has prompted more GPs to come earlier than expected to the market. Some of them returned in 2015 instead of next year.” Analysing further signs of the greater market activity, Liu said, “Currently, LPs are getting good returns from their GPs which fuels their appetite for continued returns and therefore they are looking for opportunities to invest more capital in the market as they have more money on hand.</p>
  <p>“This sometimes poses risks to LPs coming back to funds on emerging markets. They back the first fund and also provide capital for the second fund, and get pretty decent returns. Many of them re-up in the third fund as well, expecting that returns will continue to grow but actually the third time around the returns usually go down. This is a trend that we are seeing now in China.”</p>
  <p>While the likelihood of another crisis is marginal, the market is bound to correct itself, according to Liu. She said, “I cannot predict the exact point but a correction is bound to happen in the market sometime soon. Perhaps in a year or a year and a half. I do not really expect something as severe as the last crisis we had in 2007/08 but there will be some level of correction.</p>
  <p>“All the asset classes are overvalued, we are seeing that everywhere. Higher valuations are seen not only across asset classes but also across geographies. This trend is more pronounced in the US than in Europe. I can only speak from an LP perspective but a correction is good for the market in terms of investment activity. The market will be healthier for more long-term growth.” Speaking at a panel discussion during the Women’s Private Equity Network summit at the end of September, Liu provided a snapshot of the general market environment currently.</p>
  <p>She said, “One of the trends we are seeing is that a lot of GPs have delivered very good returns, distributions over the past 2-3 years given the booming markets. So, with a really good track record they are coming to the market earlier than expected, trying to get more capital from the LPs as well as larger fund sizes, and much larger than expected. From LP perspective we are also seeing that a lot of LPs, especially in the US, who got a huge amount of distribution in the past few years are struggling to deploy the capital into the GP world.</p>
  <p>“This kind of both sides demand of the LPs looking for better GPs and writing larger checks, and GPs coming back to market asking for more capital from their LPs, is quite an interesting trend that keeps everyone busy.</p>
  <p>But from the LP side we also see the valuation of all those underwriting deals GPs have been doing recently, has been very, very high in terms of the enterprise as well as the leverage ratio is coming very close to the peak before the crisis, so one of the questions we have internally is – are we seeing another crisis coming soon? There is a seven year cycle and now is seven years after the last crisis. So we are being quite cautious in terms of writing tickets to the GPs.” </p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter1-article4"></a><h2>Top quartile performance key to generating value for LPs, AltAssets Infra Forum panelists say</h2>
    <p class="text-info">Targeting the top 25 per cent of performers is an essential requisite for LPs to pick up real value from their infrastructure investments.</p>
  <p>That was the case made by Ingmar Wilhelm, managing director of Terra Firma, at a panel discussion at the AltAssets LP-GP Forum Infrastructure last week. He said, “You need an organisation that is effective and efficient and which works according to key performance indicators and they must be ahead of the market. That should normally be top quartile. That must be the objective, then you generate value.” The panel discussion, focusing on what GPs do to differentiate themselves in their value-creation approach, revealed infrastructure-specific needs.</p>
  <p>Ensuring a high level of differentiation in value creation, especially in the power sector, requires in-depth industry knowledge, said Bradford Nordholm, CEO and managing director of Starwood Energy Group. “Thinking about sources differentiation our business is quite specific and in our opinion to be active in electric power infrastructure in North America requires a high degree of specialisation.</p>
  <p>“That is because there is a rather complicated overlay of state, regional and federal regulation along with a fairly complicated overlay of different technologies and comparative values of those technologies thinking about cheap natural gas, costs of renewables, increasing compliance cost for environmental purposes and also rapidly changing commercial taste for the customers of power.</p>
  <p>“You can call it a commodity but ultimately you have to have a customer for these power plants. So, we believe very much in specialisation and having people working on these projects that have that.” Nordholm also highlighted the importance of having a strong relationship with your LPs. He said, “Sourcing is very important and particularly the way you source. A very high proportion of what we source we will self-develop from day one but a large proportion of what we source really comes about because of the partnerships that we forge with the independent developers.</p>
  <p>“And to forge such relationships requires at least a couple of things: the first one is the kind of specialisation that I was discussing and the second is having a long track record of structuring creative, commercially-sound partnership agreements. Partnerships can be very complicated, they can ruin many investments that could otherwise be good and getting structures right is critical.</p>
  <p>“We work very hard at being first call as a trusted partner for developers because we can execute well, we will do what we say we can do. If a developer has a project and maybe has just one shot of getting it done, they need to choose someone who can execute well. That is a reputation we are working to develop and frankly that becomes a very important although harder to quantify source of differentiation.”</p>
  <p>Adding to the strong relationship argument, Wilhelm said alignment of interest is critical. He said “What Terra Firma has done in the past to ensure alignment of interest with LPs is: “One – We have skin in the game, meaning we are normally the largest investor in the funds that we operate. Second: We rather go for fewer but stronger relationships which means more interaction with a select circle of people and more in-depth interaction about what to do next. And third: We will not charge fees on undeployed capital.”</p>
  <p>Wilhelm touched on the issue of LPs seeking high returns. He said, “I can say from experience that people look for alpha opportunities, which have the potential to generate above-average returns. That has to do with the quality of the pipeline, the number of opportunities that you have actively originated and where you have got a position which is either exclusive or close to it, which is bilateral, which is not an auction and secondly with the people who stand up and say they can source the deals and also implement them.”</p>
  <p>Boosting returns is among the most pressing concerns of institutional investors, according to the latest AMP Capital Institutional Investor Report. Nearly half (46 per cent) of the polled global institutional investors, with a collective AUM of US$1.9trn, put higher returns as their priority for 2015.</p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter1-article5"></a><h2>Old-school tactics can give GPs an edge in current infra market</h2>
    <p class="text-info">As the infrastructure investment market continues to evolve GPs are having to be flexible to outweigh competition – somewhere experience is playing a crucial role.</p>
  <p>That was the point made by Jean-Francis Dusch, managing director and head of Infrastructure at Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management, on the finance panel of AltAssets’ LP-GP Forum Infrastructure 2015. He said, “The market is ever changing, and in terms of players it boils down to who is old-school enough in that market and can put together clever structures for the borrowers.”</p>
  <p>Banks have recovered from the blow of the credit crunch over the last four years and are back in the market, fuelling competition. Dusch said, “Comparing the market changes over the past four years, apart from lower pricing, banks are definitely back.  Banks have been quite resilient for the top project finance’s house and I say project finance but we also know infrastructure is about refinancing, acquisition finance.</p>
  <p>“The last three months for me have been quite interesting because there are deals that are low priced, long tenures and you can see how efficient banks can be at using the balance sheet and there will be an almost similar deal, perhaps different industry, but strong credit features and the pricing is a bit better. Why? Perhaps because there are more deals and some of the banks make arbitrages again.”</p>
  <p>Michael Pfenning, managing director of Allianz Capital Partners, echoed Dusch’s assessment of more competition on the market. He said, “Banks are not only competing but are also trying to incorporate some of the smaller institutional investors in some kind of platform propositions. So that banks are providing just one instrument to the sponsor, a long-term instrument, but internally they are replicating it via the five-year bank loan and on the back they have long-term institutional money which the sponsor does not see.</p>
  <p>“Especially in acquisition financing our impression is that going to the banks in a short-term auction process in many cases is more efficient because we feel it is also difficult for the institutional debt providers, for example, to tree up during an option process when you have three, four, five competitors. So, it is more compelling first to have bank financing in place and then afterwards for the sponsors to get real long-term financing than afterwards to go to institutional debt providers or to the public bond markets.</p>
  <p>“Overall we are quite agnostic and at the end we want to have long-term financing. If we can get this during the acquisition process, that’s perfect. If we can get it afterwards, after the successful acquisition, that’s fine too.” Talking about current trends in infrastructure finance Pfenning pinpointed flexibility and stricter terms. He said, “Institutional investors are becoming more flexible and I think this is very interesting.</p>
  <p>“It’s interesting that not only banks but also institutional investors can provide debt, which is only drawn maybe over the next two, three, four years in several instalments and that is clearly competitive also compared to banks.” The stricter terms have made the market more aggressive, he commented, and added, “Sometimes people say that is for the benefit of the sponsors but effectively I think that is only partly true.</p>
  <p>“It is for the benefit of the sellers, certainly, but I think it is less so interesting for the benefit of the buyers because we rarely seem to get an edge for a better financing structure but in most cases the terms we are getting our competitors in the auction process are getting as well. So, effectively, it is more risky and at the end is also increasing our equity risk as we have to price it in, in order to be competitive.” Philippe Benaroya, managing director Infrastructure Debt at Blackrock, narrowed down the period of change to the last two years. He said institutional investors now have more broader interests, “When we started investing and pricing the first money two years ago – Europe, investment grade, brownfield, fixed rates, was what we were being asked to do.</p>
  <p>“Now it is much, much broader than that because it is investment grade but also below investment grade, its Europe but also the US, it is greenfield and brownfield, it is fixed rate, it is floating. This is great to achieve a grade quality value because we can have a much broader scope. The last thing is liquidity premium investors asking us to achieve some element of liquidity premium because they are re-allocating from fixed income. We cannot be destroying value for them when they re-allocate so we have to track very closely the pricing level of the liquid corporate bonds, the fixed-income market. We have to move in tandem with those trends.” </p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter1-article6"></a><h2>AltAssets LP-GP Forum: Lack of historical data making it harder for Infra GPs to differentiate </h2>
  <p class="text-info">In a highly competitive market, infrastructure firms are still facing the challenge of setting themselves apart from the rest and gaining an elusive edge due to a lack of data, according to panelists at the AltAssets LP-GP Forum: Infrastructure.</p>
  <p>Speaking on the creating value and generating superior returns panel, Sudarskis & Partners CEO and founder Georges Sudarskis, said, “One of the biggest issues for an investor or an LP is to identify the source of differentiation into the GP he considers. Obviously there is the investment strategy, meaning is it brownfield, greenfield or long term, but that is only one part of that. The sourcing of deals is also very important, an LP wants to see that its GP sources the deal in a differentiated manor, if possible, with non-option access to deals.</p>
  <p>He added that the scale of talent and the size of the management team is obviously very important because this also means geographical diversification and sector diversification. The LP will want to see local presence and quite often various firms have very different approaches to this. That is the differentiating facts in the mind of the investors.” Sudarskis was speaking on a panel moderated by Vishnu Amble, principal at E.ON, which also included Ingmar Wilhelm, manging director at Terra Firma, and Braford Nordholm, CEO and managing director at Starwood Energy.</p>
  <p>Wilhelm said, “What I have seen from my time at Terra Firma is people are looking for Alpha opportunities which have the potential to generate returns which are higher than average. That comes down to the pipeline, the quality of the pipeline, the number of opportunities that you have actively originated and where you have a position which is exclusive or close to it, and which is bi lateral and not an auction. The second point is you need operational excellence. You need to build people in an organisation that is effective and efficient and which works according to key performance indicators.”</p>
  <p>Earlier this month, panellists at the second annual Women in Private Equity Network (WPEN) said that communication was the key to a good LP-GP relationship. Sudarskis said that performance data remains key to differentiation, adding he was surprised by the lack of talk around issue at the AltAssets LP-GP Forum: Infrastructure. Do a degree the performance data is confidential but the data is critically important for investors. I am not just talking about track record, I am talking about fine analysis of the driver of returns.</p>
  <p>“It seems to me that the industry lacks a little bit of historical data and lacks a little bit of scientific and numerical approach of data. I think the industry need to address this, and this will be differentiating factor. The way GPs explain their performance, detail their performance to LPs and report their performance to their LPS. This is a very long duration assets class and LPs do need this amount of information.”</p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter1-article7"></a><h2>Infra GPs face rising competition from LPs, regulation, AltAssets LP-GP Forum hears</h2>
    <p class="text-info">GPs are increasingly facing competition from sources including LPs, but the biggest competitor is regulation according to panellists at the AltAssets LP-GP Forum: Infrastructure.</p>
  <p>Speaking on the Fundraising Focus panel, InfraRed Capital Partners director Sandra Lowe, said, “Some of our competitors are different in nature. Some of our competitors may be the LPs that used to be our funds. Sometimes we see contractors saying ‘instead of building a building we would like to do some investing ourselves’. But they go in cycles. To answer the question of who see as competitors you have at look at whether it is a certain point in time or whether it is in the long term.</p>
  <p>“Some of the LPs and direct investors will try to stay, some more successfully than others, while some of the contractors are a little more cyclical.” Matthias Reicherter, head of infrastructure at Golding Capital Partners, agreed that LPs are now competitors.</p>
  <p>He told the Forum, “As a fund of funds firm, our LPs are growing out of the fund of funds. They are, in a sense, understanding the infrastructure space on their own and they don’t need someone to translate between the fund and their interest anymore, so they are clearly competition. </p>
  <p>“However what I would say is that the biggest competitor is regulation – the AIFMD, the pension fund regulation which makes it very difficult for some LPs to invest into funds.” Earlier this month, panellists at the Women’s Private Equity Network Summit, agreed that the heightened regulatory environment is having less of an impact on dealmaking and more of an effect on GPs looking to access LPs. Antin Infrastructure Partners partner Sebastien Lecaudey agreed that competitors are coming from different sources, but added that it had always been difficult to do good deals.</p>
  <p>“It is not like today, where it is more difficult because of the flow of money et cetera. That is correct, but I think doing good transactions has always taken good teams, time and patience and today is no different. You can end competing with someone on a specific asset once and then you can spend four years not competing again. We all have very different strategies in the infra space, we all want to do very different things with the assets and I think it is not easy today and it wouldn’t be easy to do deals tomorrow.”</p>
  <p>Boe Pahari, global head of infrastructure equity at AMP Capital, said that whilst his firm is competing with different sources, he didn’t see it as a bad thing. I am going to interpret competition as respect. So instead of who we see as competition, it’s about who do we respect in the market? We have both competitors and collaborators at the same time. Quite often we are in the same asset together and working towards delivering the best returns for our investor and at times we are competing. But when the competition is good it should bring quality to the forefront and the best to the investment.” </p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter1-article8"></a><h2>Europe challenges Asia for top spot in future infrastructure investments </h2>
    <p class="text-info">Europe has emerged as Asia’s main rival for the top spot for future investments according to a panel discussion at the latest AltAssets LP-GP Infrastructure Forum.</p>
  <p>Commenting on which parts of the world would present the best diversification opportunities in infrastructure over the next five years, David Bates, investment director of Aventa Capital Partners, said, “I would have to say that I think the best opportunities still lie within Europe. I think we have got a lot of obsolete infrastructure which needs to be renewed. I think there are tremendous opportunities in there and comparing the returns that can be generated to the risk-rated returns that can be generated out of some of the Asian economies, I still favour Europe.”</p>
  <p>Although picking Asia as top location, Andrew Kinloch, managing director of Logie Group, agreed Europe was still being favoured by many investors. He said, “Part of that is investor perception. Investors feel comfortable working on European markets because they feel there is not going to be the regulatory risk that there might be in markets a little further afield. But in fact when the infrastructure is really required they need to keep a public perception that they do stand behind those concessions.</p>
  <p>“I think a very good example that I am aware of is the renewable energy programme that has been rolled out in South Africa where they are now on their fourth or fifth iteration of bidding for these renewable contracts. And the first two to three were very, very profitable. And things are being tightened but they have not moved away from those original franchises.” Kinloch, however, suggested that recognising the right opportunities was more important than the choice of geography.</p>
  <p>He said, “Within Asia it makes sense to follow the bigger countries and you have to do a bit less due diligence. But I will repeat my thoughts of earlier that you need to focus on particular niches, which means particular industries, in particular countries. And this is being done. Goldman has been investing in solar and wind in India for several years. They have been in Japan. I can assume they have very high hurdle rates and as far as I know they are quite happy with those investments.</p>
  <p>“But they have found a niche where they have value to add and there is less competition, and it has made sense from their point of view. Even though they may not go near an Indian road or wind in China or whatever the alternative investments are. So, I think the strategy is to identify niches, keep an eye on them, see how they are developing, see in particular who is developing them and in that enormous matrix of opportunities there occasionally be that opportunity worth pursuing.”</p>
  <p>Constantin Dogos, director infrastructure investments at Swiss Life Asset Management, agreed with the notion of choosing the right opportunities. He said, “As far as we are concerned it will be select places, select countries in Asia and similarly for LatAm. I think Africa is another step but for us as an institution is probably too exotic yet.” Andrew Yee, co-head of IFC Emerging Asia Fund, had the strongest voice in support of Asia and pointed out vulnerabilities in Europe.</p>
  <p>“On the renewable side when you look at Europe whether it be Spain, or Norway, with more pipelines than renewables, and then the more recent pronouncements in the UK on renewable tariffs. There is the regulatory risk that hits you in the pocket. And a lot of those projects are at significantly lower IRRs than, say, the equivalent in China or India.” He painted a bright future for infrastructure investments in emerging markets.</p>
  <p>“Achieving real returns in the future is going to be tough”, he said. “For those of you who have sufficient capital or sufficient risk appetite or both, it is a simple diversification. And I am not suggesting you go invest in Bolivia or Laos for example but look at China where there has been quite a lot of success over the past 20 years or so in infrastructure.  I’m not saying now is the time to invest solely in those markets, but at the IFC we consider over the next 3 to 5 years will be the best investing in emerging markets that we have seen in a long time.</p>
  <p>“And the difference between now and 5, 10, 15 years ago is many of the larger emerging markets now enable you to deploy a sufficiently large amount of capital.” Yee underlined the importance of size when speaking about future opportunities. He said, “If I was a large relatively defensive institutional investor making my first steps into the emerging markets I would go to Asia. However, if I was more dynamic and seeking more interesting returns it would be Africa, at this stage, and it depends on the size of the check. </p>
  <p>Africa is a smaller check size, there are very few hundred-million dollar deals there and you might get 20-30 per cent of that if you are lucky. So, it all depends on the size.” IFC data shows that the number one emerging market for infrastructure investments has been Asia, followed by Latin America and Central and Eastern Europe. A recent study by Armstrong International showed that European infrastructure is one of the most popular asset classes among North American investors planning to spend money on foreign infrastructure in the near future. Those investors include pension funds and endowments with assets of between $1bn and $200bn. </p>

    <p class="text-info">The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) is aiming to be the catalyst in private equity investing in emerging markets.</p>
  <p>That’s according to Anne Fossemalle, director of equity funds at the bank, who told AltAssets in an interview, “The EBRD prefers to see the risks on the emerging markets as opportunities. Each of these markets have different features, so we prefer to look at individual opportunities in each of them.” Before going into detail about specific markets, Fossemalle highlighted another priority, essential for achieving better investment returns. She said, “In all the markets in which we work, we want to see a strong model of alignment of interest between LPs and GPs.”</p>
  <p>Commenting on the biggest risks in the Turkish PE market at the moment, Fossemalle said, “There are multiple risks that investors see in Turkey, for instance, the political uncertainty or external risks stemming from the conflict in bordering Syria. Private investors value stability. They are interested in what the potential impact of these events might be on the economy and the country. This has a knock-on effect on everything, including stock markets, confidence etc.</p>
  <p>“Private commercial LPs always have the luxury of waiting until the fund is at final close. Several funds that are raising money are currently at first close. Abraaj Turkey had its first close at the beginning of the year, Taxim [Taxim Capital Partners] had its first close, Mediterra [Mediterra Capital] may perhaps also have its first close. But all private LPs have the luxury to wait until the day before the final close to actually invest or not, which makes reaching a first close a real challenge for the GPs.</p>
  <p>“On the one hand, private investors see opportunities in risks. On the other hand, the situation in southern Turkey and broader macroeconomic situation bring in uncertainty, for instance, what are the interest rates going to do in the US, how is that going to impact emerging markets’ currencies, what is going to happen to the foreign denominated debt in all of these emerging markets, what is on the front page of the newspapers etc — all of this has an impact on Turkey and other markets as well as impacting LPs perspectives on these markets. As a result, private equity investors tend to tread on the side of caution when it comes to emerging markets.”</p>
  <p>Among the LPs interested in investing in Turkey are some pension funds and endowments but also some fund of funds, according to Fossemalle. She added, “We have seen quite a bit of local Family Offices, Turkish families, investing into private equity on an arm’s length basis. Some of the fund managers are able to attract fund of funds in the final close of their first fund, so there is definitely attraction for private investors in the Turkish market.”</p>
  <p>The main attraction for investors in Turkey, Fossemalle said is that “it is a market with a lot of SMEs, enterprise creation and mid-market opportunities. She explained, “SMEs are generally attractive for the GPs who are investing in this market. The growing consumer market in Turkey is definitely a big attraction as well because of the booming population. There are also not many GPs in the country and all of them have slightly different strategies, so there are many companies available for investment, and slightly different strategies can be accessed by LPs.</p>
  <p>“It is a nascent private equity market with some GPs, some first-time GPs, which we have supported or other international organisations have supported. There are definitely new GPs coming to the Turkish market. Some are managing to fundraise. Taxim is a new one, having just had their first close. There are others who are trying or will try to raise interest in their funds.”</p>
  <p>Analysing the current PE investment environment in Central Europe, Fossemalle said, “Central Europe is mainly a European Union market, so you have the rule of law and solid regulatory systems but there are still structural deficiencies in this market that the GPs can explore. So, for example GPs are exploring consolidation across fragmented markets, and building companies to a size that is interesting for strategic investors or other financial investors that are ready to fund the next stage of growth.</p>
  <p>“The challenge for Central Europe is that the previous vintage, which is around the financial crisis period, are funds that are taking longer to mature and so GPs are coming back to market to raise their next funds whilst still bringing value to their existing portfolio. It is a challenge because they are fundraising with not so many exits.”</p>
  <p>Fossemalle sees the main challenge for North Africa in the way how investors see the market and the constant stream of negative news coming from the region does not help. She said, “There is a perception of more political risk in North Africa, which impacts the market there, as a result, private investors in general are seeing it as a more risky market. For instance, GPs that used to exist in Egypt are not around anymore. The business model disappeared during the revolution. However, Egypt is still a country that has a tradition of private equity and what we are seeing now – which is a source of a great deal of hope – is that there are some new GPs coming to market. Nevertheless, Egypt definitely has an underpenetrated private equity market.</p>
  <p>“Tunisia is a small market. Morocco definitely has some activity. We are invested in three GPs there. There is some activity also in Jordan, both in venture capital and in SME funds. Not a lot of investors are looking to invest in these markets mainly because of the news surrounding them. GPs need some positive signals from these countries to be able to propose action to their investment committees.</p>
  <p>“Even so, private LPs are likely to return at some point as they see it from a long-term perspective. They have these markets on their radar. Many LPs have considered Sub-Saharan African funds in the last year and some of these funds have mandates to access transactions in Egypt. So, LPs are definitely looking at the North African markets.”</p>

  <p class="text-info">Intense activity from corporate buyers helped private equity firms to a record year for European exits by enterprise value in 2014 according to the latest research from professional services firm EY. </p>
  <p>Its PE exit study ‘Forging ahead? How do PE investors create value’ revealed the value of PE portfolio businesses sold was a record high last year, well above the historical peak of 2006. The report also revealed new PE investments in European businesses increased to the highest level since 2008, with many mid-market European PE firms returning to deal making. The number of new investments in 2014 grew 50 per cent according to the study, which said acquisitions of businesses from corporate sellers almost doubled in 2014 compared to the previous year.</p>
  <p>European PE firms led 67 per cent of new investments, US headquartered PE firms 29 per cent and Rest of World four per cent, versus 59 per cent, 36 per cent and five per cent respectively in 2013.The study was officially launched at the BVCA Summit last week. Speaking at the event, Bridget Walsh, EY partner and head of private equity across UK & Ireland, said, “Our series of studies of European PE-backed businesses, conducted over the last 10 years, has demonstrated PE’s capacity for value creation – in absolute terms and in performance relative to public company benchmarks.</p>
  <p>“Our findings have shown that the PE business model works across Europe – by geography and industry sector and from mid-market to large investments – through careful selection of investments, alignment of incentives and a sharp focus on key value drivers. Relative to the size of portfolio, the scale of activity in 2014 was the second best year, with 17 per cent of portfolio value realised, with 2014 marking a year of significant, positive change for PE in Europe.” In terms of dry powder, funds for new deals grew in 2014 to a post downturn record, the report added. A total of 79 PE firms led new investments in 2014, up from 53 in 2013.</p>
  <p>Walsh said, “We tracked deals in the 2005-07 and the 2010-13 timeframes according to how active the acquiring firms had been over the entire period of our studies (ie, 10 years). “We found that across both of these periods, the most active firms accounted for around 60% of all new European PE deals, yet in 2014 this proportion fell to just 48 per cent. The remaining 52 per cent of new European PE deals were completed by new PE firms coming into the market – largely in the mid-market space – as well as some of the infrequent PE acquirers re-entering the new deal arena and becoming more active.</p>
  <p>“We also analysed new investments by the type and location of the acquiring fund over our study period. The overall picture is one of relative stability for across the 10-year timeframe for the proportion of deals done by most fund types. However, there is a clear trend for US mid-market funds to be acquiring in Europe.” In the 2005-07 period, US mid-market funds accounted for just 7 per cent of new deals by number.</p>
  <p>By the 2010-13 period, this proportion had increased to 11 per cent and by 2014 (before the euro currency fell against the US dollar), it had risen to 13 per cent, the data shows. Walsh concluded, “Against a backdrop of increasing dry powder and the entry of new players, the real differentiator in European PE will be in how firms source new investment opportunities and devise angles to make winning bids. This will come to the fore as we expect future growth in new investments to emanate from corporate carve-outs and take-privates – both of which require deeper country network and sector evaluation skills.” </p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter2-article2"></a><h2>California’s treasurer calls on GPs to disclose all fees</h2>
    <p class="text-info">Swiss investment firm Partners Group has purchased three stakes in a buyout fund managed by European private equity firm IK Investment Partners.</p>
  <p>California’s state treasurer, John Chiang, has reportedly called for state legislation to enforce private equity firms to disclose all fees charged to the state’s largest public pension funds, AltAssets understands. Chiang has urged that the likes of the California Public Employees’ Retirement System and the California State Teachers’ Retirement System to work with his office to develop legislation according to Reuters, which cited a letter by the treasurer. In the letter, he said all LPs, “pay excessive fees to private equity firms and do not have sufficient visibility into the nature and amount of those fees.”</p>
  <p>So far this year private equity firms have been under increasing pressure to reveal fees. Earlier this year, a coalition of state treasurers and elected officials put pressure on the SEC to push for greater transparency and fee disclosures from PE managers. In January, global private equity major KKR reportedly returned some fees to its LPs after the US securities regulator found the firm had overcharged its investors. Last week, Blackstone paid $39m to settle Securities and Exchange Commission charges over fees, just months after saying it will share 100 per cent of any deal or monitoring fees with LPs in its seventh flagship fund. </p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter2-article3"></a><h2>LP Profile: Katja Salovaara, Ilmarinen</h2>
    <p class="text-info">Ilmarinen has a focused approach to private equity. With around €2bn invested in the asset class, the Finnish mutual pension insurance company has just 15 core manager relationships and a further 10 active managers on its roster.</p>
  <p>Despite an intention to increase its allocation to private equity from the current five per cent to seven per cent over the next five years, it only expects to add a few additional managers, with much of the increase in investment coming from bigger ticket sizes and co-investments. “We have a more focused approach than you often see,” explains senior portfolio manager Katja Salovaara. “We try to keep a very concentrated manager universe and then co-invest with them, because we really believe in this investment skill and active ownership.</p>
  <p>“That’s why we are avoiding the highest fee areas and then further bringing down the cost of investment by also making co-investments with our managers.” It is an approach that has paid off. Ilmarinen started investing in private equity with a €100m budget in 1995, but ramped up the investment rate in 2000 when Salovaara joined the company. She says that the company has been through three growth phases in private equity, increasing allocation from one to three to five per cent. The increase to seven per cent by 2020 will be phase four.</p>
  <p>Net returns since 2005 are an impressive 16.6 per cent, ahead of 300-500 basis points outperformance that Salovaara believes is an appropriate premium for private equity. “We have had a good experience,” she says. “We are in it for returns. We are targeting a return premium to public equity and it’s been our highest-returning asset class. So we are increasing our allocation. We really see this as a good way of owning companies and getting a premium for that active ownership. I’m not sure if there’s a illiquidity premium to this asset class, but I think there is definitely an active ownership premium.”</p>
  <p>Salovaara is not overly concerned that the current market for fundraising, where record distributions and rising valuations are making it difficult for some LPs to meet their target allocations, will be a barrier to reaching seven per cent. If you want to increase your allocation, you have to look over a five-year time period,” she says. “Could I get to seven per cent today? I don’t really want to. It’s going to take me a while to get there in a good way, controlled for risk. It’s a marathon, not a sprint.”</p>
  <p>Most LPs are diplomatic when it comes to the question of fees and point to private equity’s impressive net returns, but that does not mean they are happy. It is not just the fees being paid to GPs, but the high internal resource cost of investing. One of the drawbacks to private equity is the high fees and costs associated with the asset class,” says Salovaara. “It’s obviously quite resource-intensive compared to other asset classes, but the main one is the high fees and costs. It doesn’t matter what segment you are in, this is a very expensive asset class.”</p>
  <p>Co-investment is one mechanism that LPs in general, and Ilmarinen in particular, are using to reduce the overall fee burden. “We’re trying avoid types and sectors of funds that are too expensive, because we are sensitive to fees,” she says. “More importantly, the key for us is to stay focused and disciplined so that all our investments matter from a size perspective. We really ensure that we reap the benefits of our scale as well and our proprietary insights.”</p>
  <p>Ilmarinen started co-investing just six years ago, investing alongside core managers that include Cinven, Permira and Silverlake, but it has already managed to achieve a 15 per cent weighting to co-invest. “First of all you have to have access to deal flow,” says Salovaara. Then, of course, you have to be able to process it, analyse it and actually get everything done in the timescale. You have to be able to make decisions and execute. It’s a totally different timescale from fund investments.”  </p>

  <p class="text-info">The Green Investment Bank (GIB) has received another £355m in commitments for the second close of its Offshore Wind Fund, the UK’s largest renewables fund.</p>
  <p>With total committed capital now standing at £818m, the vehicle now is close to the targeted £1bn. Swedish pension fund AMF and Scotland-based Strathclyde were among the investors who supported the round. Peder Hassley, chief investment officer at AMF, said, “AMF is responsible for managing the pensions of four million Swedes and is attracted to opportunities where responsible investments and good returns go hand-in-hand.</p>
  <p>“We are very pleased to have committed to GIBFS’s Offshore Wind Fund as we strongly believe that investing in UK green infrastructure fulfils both requirements.” Councillor Paul Rooney, chairman of the Strathclyde Pension Fund, said, “This is our biggest investment to date in green infrastructure in the UK. “Our fund was already working closely with the Green Investment Bank to provide finance for community-scale renewable energy projects and we are excited to follow that project by taking a stake in a long-term and globally significant investment in offshore wind power.</p>
  <p>“We are confident it is one that will deliver not only sustainable and secure energy infrastructure for the future of our communities, but a sustainable and secure future for our members who are saving for retirement.” The Offshore Wind Fund’s first close was in April this year when GIB saw £463m in commitments.  As part of the second close the fund acquired the 576 MW Gwynt y Môr offshore wind farm, located in Liverpool Bay.</p>
  <p>This brings the fund’s assets total to three wind farms which together have the capacity to produce 2,980 GWh of clean energy per year. This is enough to meet the energy needs of more than 700,000 households.

  <p class="text-info">Growth-stage investment firm Highland Europe has sealed a €332m final close for its oversubscribed second tech fund.</p>
  <p>Fergal Mullen joined Highland Capital Partners in the US in 2001, and launched the firm in Europe in 2007. He said, “The new fund was substantially oversubscribed, which reflected support for our focused strategy and early performance of Fund I. “We had the pleasure of welcoming back all investors from Fund I – with many substantially increasing their commitments. In addition, we were honoured to welcome a very limited number of sophisticated new investors who have a long-term commitment to our asset-class.”</p>
  <p>Highland Growth Technology Fund II is well above the €250m debut vehicle Highland raised in 2012, which was used to invest in 15 tech companies including WeTransfer, SocialPoint and LoveCrafts. Highland said the latest fund would continue to focus on rapidly-emerging internet, mobile and software companies, generally through investments of between €10m and €30m. Laurence Garrett, Highland Europe partner, said, “In Europe, the early-stage investment market is relatively well-funded – but there is a relative under-capitalization of the venture and growth-stage market.</p>
  <p>“In the past, deals requiring investment of €10m to €30m were over-syndicated by European investors prompting many entrepreneurs to seek capital in the US. Highland Europe is simply meeting a market need within the venture capital and growth-capital eco-system.”</p>
 
  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter3-article16"></a><h2>Strong ties to existing LPs helped Highland Europe hit second fund hard cap, exec says </h2>
  <p class="text-info">Growth-stage investment firm Highland Europe hit the hard cap in the final close of its €332m oversubscribed second tech fund thanks to solid long-term relationship with its LPs, co-founder and partner Laurence Garrett told AltAssets.</p>
  <p>All of the existing investors returned to support the second fund and it was upon their reference that new investors joined in as well. Garrett said, “We have also got interest from new investors coming in, really from our existing LPs recommendation that they speak to us, so we have been delighted with the way the fundraising has come.”</p>
  <p>Another reason for the successful close of the second fund is performance to date. Garrett explained, “I am sure there is a positive environment out there in terms of the flows of capital to LPs but I think it is also they are pleased with the Fund I performance. We have done well following true the strategy that we told our LPs we would do with Fund I and for Fund II there is no deviation in our investment strategy, which all around growth equity.”</p>
  <p>He added, “The type of new LPs are people who share long-term commitment to the asset class – endowments, pension funds who understand the asset class of growth equity in Europe and growth equity from a world-wide perspective. There are not many fund of funds in the LP base, so the other two fund types dominate.”</p>
  <p>Highland Europe has tapped its second fund already. Closed in June 2015, the fund was used to provide capital for the €10m investment in venture capital-backed Italian retail promotions platform Shopfully, it operates locally under the national brand DoveConviene. Commenting on further investments using the fund, Garrett said, “We are just investing at our usual pace of about five to six new deals a year.” </p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter3-article20"></a><h2>Forum Synergies looks to tap renewed LP confidence in India with $150m fund</h2>
  <p class="text-info">India-based private equity firm Forum Synergies is looking to take advantage of the renewed investor confidence in the country as it targets $150m for its second fund.</p>
  <p>The firm is currently in the process of raising its second fund, IKMF-II, according to its GP team comprising Samir Inamdar, Hemchandra Javeri and Sam Iyengar. Inamdar told AltAssets, “For proven, home grown fund managers such as Forum Synergies, the opportunity in India has significantly expanded. In our second fund, our strategy essentially remains the same i.e. investing in sectors where we know how to extract value and monetize the investments.”</p>
  <p>Forum Synergies’ first fund IKMF-I closed in 2012 with commitments of $50m. Like its predecessor, IKMF-II will focus on mid-market investments in select sectors filtered by GP expertise and growth opportunity. This includes Manufacturing, Healthcare, ICT, Clean tech, Education and Consumption. According to information publicly available, IFC (World bank group) was a key investor in IKMF-I. IFC’s participation gives Forum Synergies a significant boost in terms of institutional investor comfort. In large part, this is due to IFC’s rigorous selection and due diligence process.</p>
  <p>Funds allocated to Asia-Pacific on a regional level grew by 11 per in 2014 to $4bn, whilst the overall global numbers fell 7 per cent to $375bn (excluding real estate and infrastructure) according to Bain and Company’s India Private Equity Report 2015. The report said that the figures demonstrate a clear testament of LPs’ commitment to the region and in absolute terms, funds focused solely on India amounted to twice that of the prior year.</p>
  <p>Iyengar added “We are now seeing interest not only in the West but also from investors in Japan, which is now looking at growing its involvement with India. India is out of the dog house after several years. Serious investors globally are starting to re-evaluate opportunities in India.” Javeri puts the change in attitude to India down to the new Central government led by Hon. Narendra Modi which has lifted investors’ confidence levels in India’s long term prospects.</p>
  <p>“India’s macro picture is healthy and it is leading the world in terms of FDI in 2015. The IPO market has revived and the investment cycle has commenced. With the promise of more improvements in governance and business reforms, India is poised to take off and hold its growth momentum over the next few years.” Speaking about their thesis, Javeri elaborated “A key part that LPs need to understand about India is that while private equity in the west generally achieves gains through a combination of improved business outcome and leverage, one cannot depend on leverage to drive Indian investments. The key is to drive performance in portfolio companies.’</p>
  <p>Bain & Company’s report adds that whilst allocations to India slowed down in recent years, one trend that hasn’t changed is that there continues to be enough capital chasing good deals. This is due to a significant amount of capital being drawn in the country via allocations from Asia-Pacific and global funds, along with a number of large direct investments from several sovereign wealth funds according to the report.</p>
  <p>Inamdar explained that the capital invested in India in vintage years 2005-2007 had been heavily biased towards infrastructure and real estate. However, Forum Synergies stays clear of sectors that are deeply connected to complex government regulation. IKMF-II is focused on sectors which align closely with the booming consumer spending as the growing economy is expected to more than double in the coming 7-9 years.</p>
  <p>Iyengar added, “Forum Synergies does not follow a momentum strategy that has today concentrated investments in consumer and internet companies reminiscent of the US dot com era. We all know how that ended. “Our approach is more akin to a value strategy. We understand the value potential of the business we invest in, ensure thorough due diligence, we get involved and unlock the value and that makes us pretty distinctive compared to other funds.”</p>
