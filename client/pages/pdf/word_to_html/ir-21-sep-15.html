  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter1-article1"></a><h2>Global PE activity passes $42bn for August despite volume drop</h2>
  <p class="text-info">The value of global private equity transactions increased 15 per cent in August to $42.4bn despite a second monthly decline in volume, new research shows.</p>
  <p>Volume was down to 407 deals, a sharp drop from 627 in July and 675 in June according to the latest Private Equity Report from Zephyr published by BvD. It said year-on-year value was up more than two-thirds compared to the $25bn recorded in August 2014, while volume was 19 per cent higher than the 341 deals announced 12 months ago. PE value in the four weeks under review was boosted by strong investment in the US, with three of the top five deals by value targeting US-based companies, Zephyr said.</p>
  <p>US buyout giant the Carlyle Group provided equity for the top deal by value in August, which was the sale by Symantec of its information management unit Veritas for $8bn. Joining Carlyle was Singaporean wealth fund GIC. That transaction represented 19 per cent of overall PE investment during August. A German company was targeted in the number two deal by value, when a consortium consisting of Allianz, Infinity Investments (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Abu Dhabi Investment Authority), Borealis and MEAG Ergo Asset Management, part of Munich Re, announced it would acquire motorway service station operator Autobahn Tank & Rast Holding for $3.8bn.</p>
  <p>Carlyle also backed another of the month’s top 20 deals by value, picking up a 75 per cent stake in Royal Dutch Shell’s Chinese unit Shell Tongyi alongside Huo’s Group for $620m. The report revealed that in all, US companies were targeted in nine of the top 20 deals by value in August, operating in sectors ranging from software and business management and consultancy services, to department stores and commercial laundry services. Companies based in countries including China, India, Chile and the Bahamas were also targeted. US companies take lion’s share of global PE investment.</p>
  <p>PE investment targeting US companies drove the overall increase in value in August, with USD $24.8bn ploughed into the country over the four weeks. That increase came in spite of the second successive decrease in volume to 174 transactions. By volume, China was the second most-frequently targeted country in August with 45 transactions, down for the second month in a row. The UK was third with 34, again the second successive decline, and India fourth with 26. PE investment targeting the publishing and printing sector increased in August for the third month in a row. Deals worth a combined USD 9,9bn were announced in the four weeks under review, compared to $5.9bn in July, $1.16bn in June and 564m in May. </p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter1-article2"></a><h2>President Obama becomes latest politician to target carried interest</h2>
  <p class="text-info">US President Barrack Obama is to join a growing parade of US politicians who have been lining up to call for an end to a popular tax loophole used by private equity fund managers, venture capitalists and hedge fund managers, Bloomberg is reporting.</p>
  <p>The president was said to be set to make his feelings on the matter of carried interest known on Wednesday, days after Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump and former Florida governor Jeb Bush also came out against the tax break. The carried interest tax feature has been a target lately for both Democrats and Republicans looking to run for president because it is seen as a perk enjoyed exclusively by wealthy Americans, at a time when income inequality has become a major political issue.</p>
  <p>As politicians often do, Obama is expected to suggest that the money raised by closing the carried interest loophole could be used for other things – in this case, to bolster spending on needed domestic programmes, such as infrastructure, and on national security, Bloomberg said. According to Bloomberg, under the plan Obama has in mind, carried interest would be taxed as ordinary income at rates as high as 43.4 per cent, instead of as capital gains income, at a maximum 23.8 per cent rate.</p>

According to Bloomberg, under the plan Obama has in mind, carried interest would be taxed as ordinary income at rates as high as 43.4 per cent, instead of as capital gains income, at a maximum 23.8 per cent rate.</p>
  <p>At least one other US presidential candidate, former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, a Republican, brought up the matter of carried interest in previous election campaigns – in his case, during the 2012 presidential campaign. In its report on Obama’s expected taking up of the carried interest loophole cause on Wednesday, Bloomberg referred to a speech the president gave in May, in which he noted that the nation’s top 25 hedge fund managers “made more than all the kindergarten teachers in the country”.</p>
  <p>“If we can’t ask from society’s lottery winners to make that modest investment, then really, this conversation is for show,” Obama told his audience at the time, a poverty forum. Nevertheless, Bloomberg added, “Republicans in Congress have balked at the president’s plan, calling it a tax hike”. Obama’s plan would raise around $17.7bn over a decade, Bloomberg said, citing a Treasury Department estimate.</p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter1-article3"></a><h2>Non-US developed markets PE slumps, emerging markets more positive</h2>
  <p class="text-info">A weak euro was a contributing factor to private equity in developed markets outside of the US scoring lacklustre returns across 2014, according to new research from Cambridge Associates.</p>
  <p>Emerging markets investments fared better, the institutional advisor said, citing its own private equity indexes measured quarterly and on a multi-year horizon basis. Both private equity and venture capital outpaced comparable investments in the public equities markets, the firm said. Its Global ex US Developed Markets Private Equity and Venture Capital Index was essentially flat in Q4, ending the quarter up 0.1 per cent. For 2014 the index rose 3.5 per cent.</p>
  <p>Cambridge said that for comparison in terms of US dollar-based returns, the MSCI EAFE fell 3.6 per cent for the quarter and 4.9 per cent for the year. Its counterpart emerging markets index increased 4.5 per cent for the quarter and 14.3 per cent for the year. The MSCI Emerging Markets index dropped 4.4 per cent and 1.8 per cent for the quarter and year, respectively. Cambridge said the returns of both indices were helped by strong exit environments throughout 2014.</p>
  <p>It said that in Europe, PE-backed IPOs hit a historic high, while in Asia both M&A activity and IPOs were at historic or near-historic highs. Andrea Auerbach, head of global private investment research at Cambridge Associates, said, “Fund managers in the developed markets index called and distributed less capital in Q4 than in the prior quarter. “Nevertheless, Q4 marked the second highest level of capital distributions since the inception of the index: $19.6bn, which was only about a two per cent drop from the record in Q3.</p>
  <p>“Investors in funds launched in 2004 through 2008 received more than 86 per cent of the total. Fund managers called $7.2bn from their investors, about 39 per cent less than the previous quarter.” For the year, capital contributions and distributions were up 22.8 per cent and 18.1 per cent, respectively, from 2013. Distributions hit a record high of $64bn, Cambridge added.</p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter1-article4"></a><h2>Fierce trade buyer competition impacting on European bolt-on deals</h2>
  <p class="text-info">European private equity buy and build activity has hit a tough period amid increased competition from rival trade buyers, new research suggests.</p>
  <p>The first half of 2015 was noticeably less active than H2 2014 and probably only on a par with H1 2014 according to Silverfleet Capital and mergermarket, which has just published its latest European Buy & Build Monitor report. It said a total of 202 deals were made in the second half of last year, compared to 143 add-ons reported for the first half of 2015. The latter figure is likely to be revised upwards, the report added, but said those changes would probably not alter the picture that activity had dropped off between 2014 and 2015. </p>
  <p>It said the average disclosed value of add-ons in H1 2015 was £36m, based on the 30 deals with disclosed values reported in that period. That was below the upwardly revised average of £42m for the 39 deals with disclosed values announced in H2 2014, and well below the £83m average for the 27 deals in H1 2014 for which valuations are available, the report said. Silverfleet managing partner Neil MacDougall said, “Getting add-on deals done has clearly proved tougher for PE backed companies over the last half year.</p>
  <p>“Based on the experiences of our own portfolio companies the competition from rival trade buyers has been fierce, sellers price expectations have continued to rise in many sectors and due diligence can identify unacceptable risks. “On top of those issues, at a certain level of sector consolidation, the regulatory authorities become involved as some of the larger deals announced in the UK demonstrate.” The report said that despite overall buy and build activity in the Nordic region being well down, several of the noteworthy add-ons during H1 2015 occurred in that region. </p>
  <p>They included the DKK1.7bn (€230m) acquisition of Nordea Merchant Acquiring by Advent International and Bain Capital-backed Nets Holdings. Another active acquirer in Scandinavia was Cinven’s Visma, which acquired the Nordic activities of e-conomic international for an estimated DKK1.5bn as well as three other businesses in the region for undisclosed sums, the report added.</p>
  <p>Most of the other noteworthy add-ons in the period occurred in the UK. They included OMERS Private Equity-backed Lifeways Group acquiring the learning disability division of Care UK for an estimated £66m.through 71 deals, compared to $173m invested in 47 transactions during the first semester of 2014.</p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter2-article1"></a><h2>CPPIB takes Marwyn stake in film, TV business Entertainment One</h2>
    <p class="info">LP giant the Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board has agreed a £142m deal to pick up Marwyn Value Investors’ stake in film and TV business Entertainment One.</p>
  <p>The deal for 52.9 million shares will see CPPIB hold a 17.9 per cent in eOne on closing the deal, which is expected in the next 30 days. eOne specialises in acquisition, production and distribution of film and television content including well-known brands such as The Hunger Games, The Walking Dead and Peppa Pig.

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter2-article2"></a><h2>OTPP names Nicole Musicco to head Asia operations out of Hong Kong</h2>
    <p class="info">The Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan has appointed Nicole Musicco to head up its Asia-Pacific operations as regional managing director, and head of its Hong Kong office.</p>
  <p>Musicco joined OTTP in 2002, most recently serving as vice president of its Toronto office. Teachers’ opened its Hong Kong office in 2013, but until now it was the responsibility of the chief investment officer who, until he retired this past summer, was Neil Petroff. According to a statement announcing Musicco’s appointment, OTTP has a diversified portfolio of assets in Asia Pacific that was valued at C$12bn at the end of 2014.</p>
  <p>In her new role, Musicco will be responsible “for the full investment cycle, from origination to execution across asset classes in the region,” OTTP said in the statement. “Nicole’s new role reflects our growing commitment to the Asia-Pacific market and its importance to the future of our fund,” added OTTP chief executive and interim chief investment officer Ron Mock. “Her experience with our partners internationally, and her knowledge of the Asia-Pacific region specifically, made her the logical candidate for this important, newly-created position.”</p>
  <p>The announcement of Musicco’s appointment to head up OTTP’s Hong Kong office comes days after the Ottawa-headquartered Public Sector Pension Investment Board of Canada announced that it was to become the latest North American public pension fund to open a London office, and  told AltAssets that New York and Asia offices  were also planned. Last week, the Teacher Retirement System of Texas revealed it was also opening a London office, while the Toronto-based Canada Pension Plan Investment Board maintains outposts in London, New York, São Paulo, Luxembourg, Mumbai and Hong Kong.</p>
  <p>Industry observers say such overseas outposts are becoming more common because pension fund managers and other large institutional investors are looking to build up their in-house investment teams, as they seek to increase their use of direct investments in an effort to boost returns. With some C$154.5bn in assets under management at the end of last year, OTTP is said to be Canada’s largest single-profession pension plan. It looks after the pension fund’s assets and administers the pensions of 311,000 active and retired Ontario teachers. </p>
  
  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter2-article3"></a><h2>Carolina Retirement’s chief investment officer to step down</h2>
    <p class="info">Carolina Retirement System Investment Commission’s Hershel Harper is stepping down from his position of chief investment officer at the end of the month, AltAssets understands.</p>
  <p>Harper announced his impending departure at the meeting, according to a webcast. Geoffrey Berg, an internal managing director and head of public markets, has been named interim CIO according to Pensions and Investments, which cited commission spokesman Danny Varat. Carolina Retirement did not respond to a request for comment. He joined the pension fund in 2008 as director of alternatives, before becoming deputy chief investment officer six months later. </p>
  <p>He was named interim CIO in January 2012 and was handed the job permanently six months later. Prior to joining the firm, Harper was a senior institutional product manager at Evergreen Investments. Previously he was at Columbia Management where his responsibilities included managing the business aspects for institutional investment strategies, product positioning, competitive analysis, and marketing and sales support. Earlier this year, the $29.3bn state pension fund approved more than $1.5bn in commitments to five alternative investment managers.</p>
  
  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter2-article4"></a><h2>Japan’s giant pension fund, GPIF, reported in PE deal with IFC</h2>
    <p class="info">Japan’s giant national pension fund – well known for being the world’s largest fund of its kind – is about to take its first step in the direction of private equity, through a deal with the International Finance Corp, according to a published report.</p>
  <p>The $1.2trn Government Pension Investment Fund, as it’s known, will provide about $500m to the IFC to invest in private equity investments in developing countries, the Wall Street Journal said on Thursday in a report filed out of Tokyo. The WSJ cited people familiar with the deal as its source. It said it was unable to get a comment from the IFC, and that a spokesman for the GPIF declined to comment.  AltAssets wasn’t able to get a comment from the GPIF, but a spokesman for the IFC said it had no comment to make on the report.</p>
  <p>No investments have been made yet under the GPIF’s partnership with IFC, which was made final in June, according to the WSJ.</p>
  <p>In its report, the WSJ referred to the deal between the GPIF and the IFC, a part of the World Bank Group, as a “partnership”. The GPIF looks after assets on behalf of Japan’s national pension system and as well as for private-sector employee pensions. Based in Washington, DC, the IFC was created in 1956 to promote economic development in developing and un-developed countries by investing in for-profit projects in these markets.</p>
  <p>As the WSJ noted, the deal with the GPIF, if true, would be a coup for the IFC, as money managers around the world have long sought to lure the fund away from its traditional reliance on safe but often not high-yielding domestic government bonds. Last year, the fund announced it was planning to put more money into stocks and foreign bonds, and has also begun “venturing further afield into assets such as infrastructure, private equity and real estate”, which currently may comprise up to 5 per cent of its $1trn-plus portfolio, the WSJ said.</p>
  <p>It noted that the appointment of Hiromichi Mizuno as chief investment officer of the GPIF in January was probably a key factor in the fund’s apparent new willingness to consider alternative investments, and to reduce its reliance on bonds. In 2014, the GPIF’s investments returned 12.27 per cent, compared with 8.64 per cent the year before, according to an end-of-year report on its website.</p>

  <p class="info">New York-based private equity major Riverstone Holdings has edged closer towards its $8bn goal with its latest private equity fund, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
  <p>It has now raised $4.2bn for Riverstone Global Energy & Power Fund VI from 198 LPs, its latest filing reveals, which is roughly $209m more than it had reported having earlier this summer, as AltAssets reported at the time.  Riverstone began fund-raising efforts for GEPF VI in May, 2014, when it said the target was $7.5bn. Riverstone was founded in 2000 by Pierre Lapeyre and David Leuschen, who are co-senior managing directors of the company. </p>
  <p>Earlier this year, Lorde Browne, who joined Riverstone in 2007 after resigning from his job as chief executive of BP, left the company to become executive chairman of L1 Energy, an oil and gas company backed by Russian billionaire Mikhail Fridman. In October 2013, Riverstone listed a closed-ended energy investment vehicle on the London Stock Exchange called Riverstone Energy, which raised £760.3m, to invest in energy companies and assets worldwide. The vehicle is now a component of the FTSE 250 index.</p>

  <p class="info">The Carlyle Group said it plans to target what it says are “market inefficiencies across the US” with a new, $4.2bn real estate fund – its seventh.</p>
  <p>Carlyle Realty Partners VII closed on its hard cap, Carlyle said. Carlyle’s 85-member investment team will focus on the US market, searching out “opportunistic investments across all [the] major real estate sectors and major metropolitan areas”, according to a statement released on Wednesday out of its Washington, DC headquarters. Robert G Stuckey, managing director and head of Carlyle’s US real estate team since 1998, said the company believed the “robust” support of investors, as suggested by the fund’s size, reflected an “acknowledgement of our successful focus on opportunistic investments” in US real estate.</p>
  <p>In the US, Carlyle said, it has thus far completed more than 500 real estate investments across its seven funds, seeking to identify investments that benefit from strong fundamentals across 11 sectors and in 30 markets. The six prior real estate funds have been active in both residential and commercial real estate. In the residential sector, this has worked out at some 62,000 housing units, including 42,000 multi-family apartment units, and more than 20,000 senior living, student housing and for-sale residential units.</p>
  <p>In the commercial sector, real estate, Carlyle said its real estate arm has invested in approximately 41 million square feet of office, industrial, data center and retail, including investments in the San Francisco Bay Area/Silicon Valley, New York City and the Washington, DC markets. Carlyle is listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange, and currently has some $193bn in assets under management across 128 funds and 159 fund-of-funds vehicles.</p>

  <p class="info">Arboretum Ventures,  a healthcare venture cap firm based in Ann Arbor, Michigan, has closed what it says is the largest venture capital fund in the state’s history, on $220m.</p>
  <p>The fund-raising took a little under three months, according to Crain’s Detroit Business, a local publication, which noted that Arboretum’s launch filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission was dated 18 June, with a target of $215m.
