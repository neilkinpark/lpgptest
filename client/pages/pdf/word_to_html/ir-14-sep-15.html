  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter1-article1"></a><h2>IPO squeeze sees US venture exit activity slow following record 2014</h2>
  <p class="text-info">US venture capital exit activity has slowed this year following a record 2014 amid a falloff in IPO activity, new research shows.</p>
  <p>Last year’s exit activity was dominated by the $22bn sale of WhatsApp to Facebook, but even without that deal it was still a post-2000 record in terms of deal numbers and total value, data provider Pitchbook said. Its 2H 2015 VC Liquidity Report said that although total exits in H1 were not too far behind 2014 levels, IPO activity was well off last year’s pace. It said that 121 VC-backed companies went public in 2014, compared to only 42 companies through June of this year.</p>
  <p>The report said, “Market volatility will likely dictate IPO activity through the rest of the year, though the number of still-private unicorns hints at stronger IPO numbers—at some point. “Until then, acquisitions remain the exit of choice for VC, with another 385 sales finalized in 1H totaling $23bn in value.” M&A made up 90 per cent and 85 per cent of VC exit counts and value, respectively, through the first half, Pitchbook said.</p>
  <p>Large exits of $500m-plus accounted for the lion’s share (58 per cent) of total capital exited in 1H, down slightly from 63 per cent in 2014. Most years going back to 2006 saw $500m-plus exits account for 40 per cent or less of total exit value, and sometimes as little as 21 per cent, as in 2009. Pitchbook said “The decline in activity, however, does not come as a major surprise, with other exit ramps simply being more attractive for sellers at this point.</p>
  <p>“Public markets have moved sideways through 2015 as investors decide whether to pair back holdings at all-time high valuations or to buy the lows. “This dynamic makes it difficult for private backers to price prospective offerings for portfolio companies, which can point them towards alternative exit routes. Median IPO valuations have also continued a near linear decline since 2011, when venture-backed IPO valuations reached $426m.</p>
  <p>“1H 2015 saw this number come in at just under $219m, a drop of around 13 per cent compared to the median initial offering value in 2014. While we’ve seen a few notable tech offerings this year, such as Etsy, Fitbit and Box, technology public debuts, which tend to account for a hefty amount of frothy IPO values, have actually dropped significantly, a potential reason for the notable decline in median IPO exit values. If public markets continue to undergo turmoil as we’ve seen over the past few weeks, we expect VC-backed IPO activity to perform similarly in the near future.”</p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter1-article2"></a><h2>Politics still stymying emerging market infra deals, says Aberdeen AM’s Cohen</h2>
  <p class="text-info">LP investors looking at the eye-watering costs of infrastructure entities in established, ‘first world’’ global markets might be forgiven for wondering why so few desirable opportunities are being offered up in infra-starved parts of the world.</p>
  <p>With so much dry powder chasing the best infra opportunities in the US and Europe, it’s difficult to resist the temptation to think that there surely must be deals to be done somewhere in the under-paved, under train-line-served, pipeline-free, largely water- and sewer-system free and electricity-constrained expanses of Africa, South America and Southeast Asia.</p>
  <p>But Gershon Cohen, who heads up Aberdeen Asset Management’s infrastructure investment business, says there’s a very simple reason everyone is chasing the same few deals on offer in the US, Europe and Australia, in spite of the competition and the prices: politics. The biggest obstacle to investing anywhere is corruption, and a lack of credible, stable political and legal systems in place,” he says.</p>
  <p>“Even in the countries that have political stability and a robust legal system – in the UK, France and Germany, for example – the next challenge is whether there is a general understanding that the private sector is the correct choice to be building and managing the infrastructure – as opposed to the public sector, for example, as more politically left leaning governments might argue. Because in some places, there is still a lot of ideological objection to involving the private sector in managing and financing key infrastructure projects. </p>
  <p>“ Yet despite this, one needs significant willpower and confidence in the political systems of some emerging market countries to invest in an infrastructure deal being offered in them.” Fortunately for those lacking in such willpower and confidence, the infrastructure in many of the countries with the least-corrupt and most stable political systems is quite old and in need of renewal, Cohen points out. As recently as September, he says, a wooden water pipe was unearthed in a Washington, DC suburb.</p>
  <p>(The World War I-era pipe hadn’t actually carried water since 1940, according to an article in the Washington Post, though it noted that “water utility and infrastructure nerds [nevertheless] rejoiced” at the find.) Foreign visitors to the US, meanwhile, often remark on the poor condition of the highways that connect JFK Airport, on the outskirts of New York City, with the central district of Manhattan; and the fact that a direct airport rail link doesn’t even exist here, in the financial capital of the world’s largest economy.</p>
  <p>Cohen discussed his views on infrastructure with AltAssets recently from Aberdeen’s offices near St Paul’s Cathedral in London. They’re offices Cohen doesn’t spend much time in, he says a bit ruefully, given his need to travel the world with his colleagues in their quest to find the best infrastructure investments for Aberdeen’s clients. Cohen has been involved in infrastructure investing for more than 20 years, including a stint as head of infrastructure finance at HBOS. </p>
  <p>That was followed by another as global head of project finance at Lloyds Bank, and then, from 2009 onwards, as chief executive and principal of what eventually became the infrastructure arm of Scottish Widows Investment Partnership. After Aberdeen acquired SWIP in 2014, he and his 25-member team moved over to Aberdeen – which, he says, has been in the process of building its alternative investment offering for the past 18 months, as it seeks to diversify its business.</p>
  <P>“Aberdeen manages half a trillion dollars of assets for institutional and retail investors on a global basis, and the SWIP acquisition was its biggest demonstration, up to that point, of its clear intention” of diversifying, he explains.  More recently Aberdeen demonstrated its commitment to further diversification into Alternatives by announcing, in May, that it was to acquire Flag Capital Management, a US-based private equity firm; and then, in August, saying it is to acquire Arden Asset Management, a specialist hedge fund manager, with offices in New York and London.</P>
  <p>One of the curious things about infrastructure is that it is (“for good reason”, Cohen says) something that “everyone” is looking to add to their portfolio at the moment – in spite of the fact that it is notoriously difficult to define as an asset class.</p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter1-article3"></a><h2>Foreign funds help Israeli PE industry to quarterly record</h2>
  <p class="text-info">Israeli private equity performance hit a quarterly record in Q2 of this year, with 29 deals made amounting to $1.67bn in capital, new research shows.</p>
  <p>The quarterly amount invested in PE deals was the highest in three years, and far above the $145m and the $385m invested in Q2 2014 and Q1 2015, respectively, data from the IVC Research Centre and Shibolet & Co law firm revealed. Such a strong quarter helped the country’s private equity industry to its best first-half of a year since 2011, with 44 deals totalling $2.1bn. That quadrupled H1 2014’s $592m invested in 44 deals.</p>
  <p>Israeli private equity fund investments accounted for $447m or 22 per cent, of total investments, the report said. That compares with $355m (60 percent) invested in H1 2014 and $208m (23 per cent) in H1/2013. The largest deal by an Israel PE fund was the $97m buyout of paper manufacturer Hadera Paper by FIMI in Q2. IVC and Shibolet said the bulk of PE investments were made by foreign PE funds, which dramatically increased their activity in Israel in Q2 2015 with $1.3bn, capturing 78 per cent of all investments.</p>
  <p>The amount was only marginally lower than the $1.4 billion (83 per cent of total) invested in Q3 2014 – the strongest quarter for foreign PE fund activity to date. Omer Ben-Zvi, partner at Shibolet & Co, said, “The last quarter manifests a continuous growth of the Israeli private equity industry, despite relatively low number of transactions in the previous two quarters. “The year’s second quarter demonstrates the stability of the local market with two big buyouts alongside a larger number of medium sized deals.</p>
  <p>“In addition to the reinforcement of the Israeli PEs activity, we are also seeing a continuing trend of hightech buyouts by foreign PE funds, further attesting the maturity of the local tech industry and its global integration. Foreign PE funds already active in Israel have been accelerating their deal making for some time now, and new PEs, including Chinese investors, are more and more active.</p>
  <p>Marianna Shapira, research manager at IVC Research Center, added, “Israeli high-tech companies appealed to many private equity investors, leading with $1.4bn in capital. “We’ve observed this rapidly growing interest in local high-tech, as the sector’s share in PE investments grew constantly from quarter to quarter, starting in the end of 2013, and peaking at 81 per cent of total investments in Q2 2015.</p>
  <p>“In comparison, the Israeli high-tech captured 78 per cent and 54 per cent in Q1 2015 and Q2 2014, respectively. “While in both previous quarters technology deals led in share, with an upward trend, technology investments leaped from $80m in Q2 2014 when this trend first started, to current levels at multiples of nearly 18 times that amount. “Judging from the current development trend in Israeli hightech and our conversations with investors, PE funds suppose that Israeli technology sector offers various engagement opportunities.”</p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter1-article4"></a><h2>Latin American PE fundraising records massive jump in H1 2015 close</h2>
  <p class="text-info">Private equity and venture capital fundraising across Latin America soared by more than 20 per cent year-on-year in the first half of 2015, new research shows.</p>
  <p>Firms raised a total of $4.27bn according to the latest data from the Latin American Private Equity and Venture Capital Association. Investment activity was also up 39 per cent to $3.58bn, while exit capital generation rose eight per cent to $1.74bn. LAVCA president and executive director Cate Ambrose said, “Concerns over the slowdown in growth or the need for ongoing structural reforms appear to be outweighed by the opportunity to invest dollars in funds that will make investments in heavily depreciated local currencies.</p>
  <p>“PE/VC firms active in Latin America are putting money to work in new and follow on deals, particularly in Brazil where an environment of adversity is creating new opportunities for investors.” The report said H1 2015 was the the strongest first semester for fundraising since 2011 when $4.9bn was raised in the region. LAVCA noted that vehicles with a pan-regional focus represented 35 per cent of the fundraising totals, more than three times the capital raised during the same period last year.</p>
  <p>It added, however, that its projections indicated fundraising will slow and year-end totals will fall short of the record set in 2014 as managers concentrate on deploying capital. Brazil, Mexico, and the Andean region all saw increases in investment activity in the period under review. Brazil captured $2.28bn through 69 transactions, compared to $1.89bn via 50 deals in 1H 2014. Capital invested in Mexico surged to $978m, up from $403m, and the Andean region received $304m, compared to the $265m it captured during the same period last year. </p>
  <p>LAVCA said that growing demand for logistics and energy-related infrastructure in the region was reflected in capital raised by PE infrastructure funds targeting these sectors, which made up almost 50 per cent of the fundraising totals for the region. Similarly, investments in energy, oil & gas, and logistics in Brazil and Mexico dominated among large-cap transactions (ticket sizes over $100m). </p>
  <p>Overall, healthcare was the top sector for investment with $810m deployed, and the most dynamic sector was IT with 62 transactions, an increase of 44 per cent year-on-year. Venture capital and early stage activity also continued to gain momentum in the first half of 2015. The region overall deployed $264m through 71 deals, compared to $173m invested in 47 transactions during the first semester of 2014.concentrated basis.</p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter2-article1"></a><h2>Oregon State Treasury taps ex-Hermes GPE’s Langdon for its PE biz</h2>
  <p class="text-info">The Oregon State Treasury has named Michael Langdon, a former head of Hermes GPE’s US operations, to head up its private equity investment business.</p>
  <p>He succeeds Jay Fewel, whose retirement last year after 24 years at the Treasury prompted a reorganisation of the entity’s investment office, according to published reports. At the Treasury, he reports to John Hershey, who oversees the Treasury’s alternatives investment business.</p>
  <p>Hermes GPE is a London-based specialist investment business that evolved out of a combining of the private equity businesses of Hermes Investment Mangement, which was originally founded to manage the BT pension fund’s assets, and the private equity assets of Gartmore, a UK asset manager that ran into difficulty after an IPO.</p>
  <p>Oregon was an early entrant into the area of private equity, having entered the sector as an investor in the 1980s. The Oregon Public Employees Retirement System is said to be the United States’ 14th largest pension scheme.</p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter2-article2"></a><h2>Another North American LP is establishing a London outpost</h2>
  <p class="text-info">The Ottawa-headquartered Public Sector Pension Investment Board of Canada has become the latest North American public pension fund to open a London office, and has named Simon Marc to head it up.</p>
  <p>A New York office is also planned, as is, eventually, one in Asia, a PSP Investments spokesman said. Marc, pictured, comes to PSP Investments from the Paris office of Permira, and has been given the title of managing director and head of European private equity at PSP. He officially began his new role with the firm in August, although the office itself has yet to be formally opened. </p>
  <p>At PSP Investments, Marc’s role “will be to set-up the office [and] expand the [organisation’s] network of partners and pipeline of opportunities in Europe”, the PSP Investments spokesman told AltAssets. Marc’s appointment and the announcement of the pending opening of a London office comes months after PSP Investments signaled its intention of expanding its global footprint with a long-term, on-the-ground presence in key foreign markets.‎</p>
  <p>As reported here last week, the Teacher Retirement System of Texas (TRS) has revealed it is also opening a London office, in the central Mayfair district, in an effort to increase the number of available investment opportunities. The Toronto-based, C$268.6bn Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, meanwhile, not only already has a London office but has additional outposts in New York, São Paulo, Luxembourg, Mumbai and Hong Kong, according to its website.</p>
  <p>Other North American pension funds with London offices include Alberta Investment Management Corp, which opened its in 2014, and OMERS Private Equity,which also has a New York office. Industry observers say such overseas outposts are going to become more common, as some of the largest pension funds – which these are – like growing numbers of larger limited partners of all types, are building up their in-house investment teams as they look to increase their use of direct investments, in an effort to boost returns.</p>
  <p>PSP Investments has around C$112bn of assets under management.  It looks after the pension fund assets of various Canadian public services, including the Canadian armed forces, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Canadian Reserve Force. As reported here in May, PSP Investments is joining forces with another Canadian pension giant, the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan, and an arm of the Spanish banking group Santander to launch an entity called Cubico Sustainable Investments that will invest in and manage renewable energy and water infrastructure assets around the world. The announcement of the Cubico launch was seen at the time as another example of major institutional investors looking to do more of their own direct investing, in this case in infrastructure.</p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter2-article3"></a><h2>CalPERS execs to meet with disgruntled board member over fee concerns</h2>
  <p class="text-info">The management of CalPERS, the giant California pension fund, has responded to a highly critical letter to the fund’s chief executive from one of its board members by offering to meet them and discuss their concerns.</p>
  <p>It also issued a two-page “fact sheet” about its private equity programme, including its average investment returns, net of fees including carried interest, over one, three, five, 10 and 20 years. It says that since the programme began in 1990 those investment returns range from 8.9 per cent to 14.5 per cent across the five time periods mentioned.</p>
  <p>It adds, “During these time periods, the returns have outperformed our peers in public pensions, according to an August report to the CalPERS Board of Administration.” In his letter to CalPERS chief executive Anne Stausboll, which AltAssets has seen, board member Joseph Jelincic expressed his “dismay” over responses CalPERS’ investment staff offered to his questions about private equity fee structuring at a meeting of the pension fund’s Investment Committee on 17 August.</p>
  <p>Jelincic criticised the pension fund’s support of what he called GP “propaganda” by not, as he understood it, being more clear about the mechanics and flows of management fees between GPs, LPs and portfolio companies.  “The role of the CalPERS staff, it seems to me, is not to propagate GP propaganda to the board but to guard against it”, Jelincic wrote.</p>
  <p>His central argument seems to be the failure of CalPERS’ investment staff to answer his questions in a way that he said suggested CalPERS managers may not be “meeting their most basic social and governance responsibilities to pay their taxes, and CalPERS is potentially abetting them”. He also complained of an “overall tone toward me… of condescension”.</p>
  <p>The existence of Jelincic’s letter, dated 23rd August, became widely known after its existence was reported in the Financial Times on Monday. Monday was Labor Day in the US, and CalPERS’s offices in Sacramento were closed. A spokesman for CalPERS has since forwarded a copy of the contents of a letter sent by Henry Jones, chairman of CalPERS’ Investment Committee, in response to Jelincic.</p>
  <p>Jones wrote, “I am scheduling a meeting with you, Anne [Stausboll], Ted [Eliopoulos, CalPERS’ chief investment officer], [CalPERS’] investment staff, and PCA [Pension Consultancy Alliance, a US pension consultancy] to review the questions you have asked. The purpose of the meeting is to ensure that we understand your questions and the issues you have raised. “Following the meeting, staff and PCA will prepare a written response to address the issues.”</p>
  <p>Jones added that he was not planning to include the matter as an agenda item at the September Investment Committee “at this time”, saying that “after reviewing the situation, I feel the most appropriate manner in which to proceed is outlined above”. If, after this process, it turns out that there is a correction that needs to be made to the record, we will take appropriate steps.” Finally, addressing Jelincic’s allegation of “condescension”, Jones said, having himself been present at the meeting, “I do not agree there was a ‘breach of decorum’ by staff”.</p>
  <p>Jelincic appears to be something of a crusader. In April, an article in the Sacramento Bee reported that “CalPERS maverick board member JJ Jelincic” was “at it again”, after he had hand-delivered a letter to the offices of California State Attorney General Kamala Harris in which he complained of a policy that excluded him, despite being a CalPERS board member, from participating in performance and pay decisions for the fund’s top executives.</p>
  <p>“No other board member has similar limitations, but none have Jelincic’s employment history: 25 years in CalPERS’ investment office, including several working directly under current executives until he went on full-time leave to work on board business,” the Bee article said. On Wednesday, Jelincic told AltAssets that he had not yet had a response from the attorney general to his letter.</p>
  <p>As AltAssets has been reporting for the last several months, the issue of giant public pension funds not being as transparent as their critics say they should be about their private equity investments has been a growing issue in the US and elsewhere. CalPERS, which has a private equity portfolio said to be around $30.5bn, has been a particular target ever since CalPERS executives admitted that they had no idea how much they had been paying their private equity providers in fees for years.</p>
  <p>In August, as reported,  CalPERS CIO Eliopoulos said the pension fund manager would require the private equity managers it works with in the future to be transparent about the fees they charge, as well as how much money they’re making from the portfolio companies they own. He made his comments after the 17 August meeting that prompted Jelincic’s letter.</p>
  <p>As reported here last week,  the Institutional Limited Partners Association, which represents more than 300 pension funds and other private equity fund investors globally, has announced it is launching an effort to establish “more robust and consistent standards for fee and expense reporting and compliance disclosures among investors, fund managers and their advisers”.</p>
  <p>CalPERS (California Public Employees’ Retirement System), which looks after $300bn in assets on behalf of current and retired state employees in California,  is in the process of installing a new reporting system to better track the fees and expenses it’s paying those those external companies that look after its private equity portfolio.</p>
  <p>It has also said it plans to cut by more than half the number of private equity fund managers it uses, and that it is likely to consider companies’ fee structures when making its decision as to which ones to keep.</p>

  <p class="text-info">New York-based private equity firm JLL Partners, which has been raising money for its seventh buyout fund only since January, has begun to make purchases with the funds raised so far according to a source close with knowledge of the vehicle.</p>
  <p>So far it has closed on one company in the aerospace and defence sector and another in the building products area, and has agreed to purchase a third, also in the aerospace business, which is expected to close later this month, the source told AltAssets. Through these acquisitions JLL is beginning to deploy some of the $624m in capital that, as AltAssets reported on 10 September, it has registered thus far, as it makes its way towards its $1.1bn target.</p>
  <p>A company spokesman declined to comment on the matter, citing US Security and Exchange Commission regulations. SEC documents show that the $624m raised so far for Fund VII has come from some 61 LPs. JLL Partners is understood to be holding off on a final close of Fund VII until the first quarter of 2016 in order to accommodate at least one investor. Jefferies is acting as a placement agent for the fund, which is has a hard cap of $1.1bn. Since its launch in 1988 by Paul Levy, JLL has committed $4.2bn across its six prior   funds, according to the JLL website.
