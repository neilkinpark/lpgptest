  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter1-article1"></a><h2>Upper mid-market price inflation still growing despite Q2 relief</h2>
  <p class="text-info">Price inflation in the upper mid-market appears to still be growing despite temporary relief in the second quarter, new research suggests.</p>
  <p>Two quarters of enterprise value/EBITDA multiples of five-times or more approaching 80 per cent of deals was followed by a dip in Q2 according to the latest PE Deal Multiples and Trends report from Pitchbook. Despite that, the proportion of deals with multiples exceeding 7.5-times remained steady. Pitchbook said, “Coupling that with the uptick in median EV/EBITDA multiples in the $250m-plus bucket, it’s likely price inflation in the upper middle market is growing, especially given the popularity of the middle market as of late.</p>
  <p>“Overall, EV/EBITDA multiples seem to have declined from 1Q, but that could be a result of EVs expanding and consequently pricing into different size buckets. Between 1Q and 2Q, median EV/revenue multiples surged across the board, supporting that inference. That increase led to the biggest percentage of EV/revenue multiples exceeding 2x yet recorded in this report series—over 40 per cent. With dry powder ample and strategic competition strong, valuations may well stay within that lofty range for some time.”</p>
  <p>The report went on to say that Q2 marked the third consecutive quarter debt levels stayed quite low compared to 2013 and 2014, at 52 per cent. It said regulatory scrutiny had helped keep leverage down, especially with banks increasingly shying away from such risk. Pitchbook said, “Even though nonbank lenders such as BDCs are filling the gap and money remains cheap, PE investors are deploying debt cautiously. Equity and senior debt still make up close to 80 per cent of the average deal amount—even if that is on the lower end of what we’ve seen, it still speaks to moderation.</p>
  <p>“Dealmakers have been particularly moderate with regard to employing equity. The proportion of equity used has been waning for some time now, likely due to buyers’ reluctance to overpay and depress potential returns. In light of the Fed’s decision to leave interest rates unchanged, the flow of inexpensive financing will persist for a little while longer, so there could be an uptick in investors tapping debt markets, but caution is likely to reign still.” </p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter1-article2"></a><h2>Profitable growth focus helped Silversmith close debut fund after three months, exec says</h2>
  <p class="text-info">Silversmith Capital Partners’ focus on profitable growth companies helped it close its debut fund above its initial target in just three months according to managing partner Jeffrey Crisan. </p>
  <p>The newly formed growth equity firm, which targets companies in the technology and healthcare space, recently closed its debut fund on $460m. The vehicle landed a $25m commitment from the University of Michigan, with the rest coming from a traditional mix of endowments, foundations, fund of funds, and some insurance companies and pension investors. Crisan told AltAssets, “We were pretty fortunate, it went reasonably quickly. We started in May and wrapped up the fundraising in August, so from that perspective it was certainly better than our expectations.</p>
  <p>“As we are a first time fund, there were natural questions around – can we work together well, can we make decision making as a new entity. We were really fortunate to have a lot of interest from the LP meeting community that enabled us to raise the capital in a little over three months. Overall, we believe that it went quickly because our focus on profitable, growth companies both resonated with investors and aligned well with our experience.”</p>
  <p>The firm’s strategy, which is lower mid-market growth equity investing, is the same strategy that the three managing partners (Crisan, Todd MacLean and Jim Quagliaroli) have done for the past 15-plus years. The vehicle will look to make investments in US-based companies ranging from $15m to $50m so there will likely be 18 over the next 15 to 18 years according to Crisan. He admits that while competition in all of the markets remains high, and is likely to stay high in the foreseeable future, Silversmith’s target sector is opening up.</p>
  <p>“While our segment is also competitive, we benefit from that fact that other that growth equity players have raised significantly larger funds over time which has moved them up and outside of our sweet spot, whether its TA or General Atlantic, these are many funds who used to participate in this segment once upon a time but have now raised $3bn-plus fund sizes.” Earlier this year, TA Associates was reported to be trying to raise about $4bn for its latest global fund to invest in companies seeking growth capital.</p>
  <p>With the segment packed full of competition, the pricing has also certainly trended up over time, says Crisan. However he still sees a lot of interesting investment opportunities where the firm can work with strong management teams to help them accelerate the growth of their businesses, and in turn drive great returns.  He added, that while the fund will primary focus on investments across the US, it may also invest internationally. There are a lot of great firms in the Boston VC and private equity community and there are a lot of great firms in the Valley as well.</p>
  <p>“It’s hard for me to compare and contrast the markets as our focus on both high growth and profitable companies in technology and healthcare means that we tend to compete across the country and, while we certainly find a lot of interesting opportunities in Boston and Silicon Valley, most of our investments have been outside of Boston and northern California. Our strategy is reasonably straight forward. Our plan is to do one thing, do it really well and do it one office. We want to keep the organisation very simple and focused on one type of investing in the two sectors we know really well.” </p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter1-article3"></a><h2>PE, infra could see boost from EU capital markets action plan</h2>
  <p class="text-info">The European Union could be preparing to provide a boost to private equity and infrastructure after reports emerged it is considering easing capital charges on insurers.</p>
  <p>An action plan from EU financial services chief Jonathan Hill detailing the proposals is set to be published on September 30, Reuters reported. It said actions within the plan included easing capital requirements for credit unions and local savings and loans organisations which had been written for banks. Other proposals reportedly include a new breed of “simple and competitive” personal pensions in the EU. It said, “There is no single measure that will deliver a Capital Markets Union. </p>
  <p>“Instead there will be a range of steps whose impact will cumulatively be significant.” Last month Castik Capital investment partner Michael Phillips told AltAssets that non-European investors had become more comfortable with the political and economical uncertainty in Europe over the last 18 months. He was speaking in the wake of Luxembourg-based Castik Capital sealing one of the largest first-time fundraises on the continent by hitting its €1bn hard cap.</p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter1-article4"></a><h2>Australian PE favouring sales over IPOs following share drop</h2>
  <p class="text-info">Following China’s stock market crash earlier this year, Australian private equity firms are favouring trade sales rather than initial public offerings (IPO), AltAssets understands.</p>
  <p>So far this year, private equity-backed trade sales are worth more than in each of the previous three complete years, with $1.42bn worth of deals up to mid-September according to Thomson Reuters data. Last month the Chinese stock market plunged after concerns over the country’s slowing growth triggering a global sell-off. The Shanghai Composite, China’s main stock exchange, fell 7.6 per cent losing 8.5 per cent on what state media dubbed China’s “Black Monday”.</p>
  <p>This year has seen Sydney shares off nearly 8 per cent so far and institutions appear to be more selective due to the poor performance. So far in 2015 IPOs backed by private equity have fallen to $1.47bn, compared to 2014’s record $6bn. In May Bain Capital’s Australian accounting software company, MYOB , raised A$833m ($658m) in what was the country’s biggest IPO of the year at the time. Two months later, New York-based Paine & Partners raised A$550m ($400.8m) following Costa Group’s IPO, making it the second largest IPO in the country this year.</p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter2-article1"></a><h2>Family offices favouring direct PE exposure over funds, co-investments</h2>
  <p class="text-info">The average family office portfolio now boasts about 22 per cent exposure to private equity, including venture capital and co-investment, new research suggests.</p>
  <p>About two-thirds of family offices engage in private equity activity directly, rather than through funds or co-investment opportunities according to The Global Family Office Report 2015, produced by Campden Wealth Research (CWR), in partnership with UBS. It says that the average family office, with assets under management of $806m, will now have invested approximately $177m in private equity activity.</p>
  <p>That data came from a survey of more than 224 family offices in 37 different countries, CWR said. Collectively the participating family offices represented well over $200bn in private wealth. The report said, “As an illiquid asset class, private equity is particularly relevant to family offices because of its longer investment horizon and their search for alpha. Office participation varies, with two-thirds of those involved in private equity investing in deals directly, rather than through limited partnership funds, co-investment opportunities, or deals syndicated via an investment.</p>
  <p>“Dealing directly resonates with family offices as it allows the office to take an interest in the management of a firm and leverage its expertise for success. It also holds attraction as it lets family offices utilise personal networks as well as avoid the fees of private equity funds.” Co-investment with other family offices – either through office-to-office deals or syndicated through private banks – typically constitutes about one-tenth of a family office’s private equity allocations annually, or about 2.2 per cent of the overall, CWR said.</p>
  <p>It added that although there has been growing enthusiasm for co-investing within the space, participants in the survey stressed the importance of finding the right partners, and the protracted courtship that may take. CWR CEO Dominic Samuelson said, “Personal networks are key for the formation of co-investing opportunities between family offices. Often friends, family, mutual business associates, all fall into this network.</p>
  <p>“Because of this, the primary focus for co-investing is trust and a mutual risk appetite. Quite often deals fall through as individuals do not take the time to learn the others requirements.” UBS global family office group vice chairman Philip Higson added, “A defining feature of family offices is their preference for long-term investing and their ability to manage ‘patient capital’, which is a clear competitive advantage when it comes to private equity. “They are committed to this space but the reality is you have to be quick on your feet to execute.” </p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter2-article2"></a><h2>Kentucky Teachers’ promotes Siderewicz to CIO</h2>
  <p class="text-info">Kentucky Teachers’ Retirement System has promoted deputy chief investment officer Tom Siderewicz, AltAssets understands.</p>
  <p>The $18.4bn pension fund has handed Siderewicz the role of chief investment officer, replacing Paul Yancey who will retire at the end of the month. Yancey joined Kentucky Teachers’ in 1986 as an analyst and worked his way to the top, eventually taking the CIO role from Stuart Reagan in 2004. KTRS’ assets grew from around $5bn to $18.5bn, as of June 30, and its annualised return over the past 20 years, as of the end of December, was 8.2 per cent, according to KTRS’ latest report.</p>
  <p>Siderewicz joined the retirement system in 2011 after an 11 year stint at Century Management Investment Counselors as a fixed income portfolio manger according to his LinkedIn profile. Before joining Century Management, he spent four years as a fixed income trader at Charles Schwab & Co. In March, Kentucky Teachers’ earmarked $180m to three private investment vehicles, Carlyle Group’s Europe Partners IV, Real Estate Partners VIII and Rockwood Capital Real Estate Partners X. </p>

  <p class="text-info">New Jersey Pension Fund has made up to $987m in commitments and investments to alternatives according to the New Jersey Division of Investment.</p>
  <p>In private equity, the division committed up to $100m to Catalyst Fund V according to reports presented to the State Investment Council, which governs the investment policies of the division of investment. Back in April the Catalyst Capital Group, a Vancouver-based private equity firm focused on distressed investing, raised $650m in the first close of its fifth fund. The $79bn pension fund also committed $100m to TSG7 A and $25m to TSG7 B, both managed by TSG Consumer Partners. New Jersey also backed Dyal Capital Partners III with $200m and PW Real Estate Fund III with $102m. It is also handed up to $100m to a related co-investment separate account managed by a unit of Neuberger Berman.</p>

  <p class="text-info">Private equity firm Pine Brook is among investors backing the $500m launch of new real estate-focused asset management company Tunbridge Partners.</p>
  <p>Quantum Strategic Partners, a private investment fund managed by Soros Fund Management, has also put up shareholder capital for the business – a perpetual life investment company which said it was also backed by a strong institutional shareholder base. It added that extra institutional investors were expected to include several US-based public and corporate pension plans.</p>
  <p>Tunbridge plans to make investments, generally structured as minority equity interests, in investment managers focused on real estate and real assets across property sectors, strategies and geographies. Chairman Brian Finn has more than 30 years of experience in the financial services industry, including as co-president of Credit Suisse First Boston and CEO of Credit Suisse USA. </p>
  <p>Portfolio manager Sean Gallary was a managing director at ORIX USA Asset Management, where he was responsible for investing ORIX USA’s capital in asset management activities, including strategic acquisitions. Company affiliate Hodes Weill & Associates, a real estate advisory firm, will provide the firm access to global institutional coverage and distribution services. </p>
  <p>Pine Brook managing director William Spiegel said, “We are very excited to back Brian, Sean and the Hodes Weill team as they pursue this great opportunity.

Tunbridge is purpose-built to address this need.”</p>

  <p class="text-info">Texas-based Trive Capital Holdings looks to have closed its oversubscribed second fund on $468m, AltAssets can reveal.</p>
  <p>Trive Capital Fund II has collected commitments from 55 LPS, with minimum investment priced at $100,000 according to a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Part of the vehicle is being raised through Trive Capital Fund II (Offshore) according to a separate filing. In 2013 the mid-market firm closed its oversubscribed debut fund on $300m, smashing its initial $250m target, and reaching its hard-cap in five months.</p>
  <p>Fund I received support from investors globally, partnering with public and private pension funds, endowments, foundations, fund of funds and family offices. Although it is unclear at this stage whether the new fund will follow the same make-up. Trive managing partner Conner Searcy previously told AltAssets that’s its focus on the lower mid-market and its operational strategy was helpful in attracting investors for Fund I.</p>
  <p>According to its website, it is an industry-agnostic and situation specific firm with substantive experience and relationships across a number of sectors. Trive looks invest between $10m and $75m per transaction, in companies with revenues ranging from $30m to $500m.

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter3-article3"></a><h2>North Bridge Venture Partners halts $200m Fund VIII raise</h2>
  <p class="text-info">Experienced early-stage investment firm North Bridge Venture Partners has scrapped fundraising for its eighth flagship vehicle following an exodus of staff, it is understood.</p>
  <p>North Bridge was hoping to collect up to $200m for Fund VIII according to a regulatory filing made last year, already far less than the $530m it had gathered for its predecessor fund. The firm has now thrown in the towel on that fundraise and several of its remaining partners are moving on according to Fortune, which cited an email from North Bridge partner Paul Santinelli. In it he cites a lack of interest in early-stage investing outside of the consumer internet space, which North Bridge does not invest in, and a lack of liquidity in current portfolios. </p>
  <p>He adds that Fund VIII has been “paused”, and that the firm will revaluate LP appetite for “inception-based investing” over the next 12 months. North Bridge’s growth equity business is reportedly unaffected by the moves. Fortune added that North Bridge general partners Michael Skok and Jonathan Heiliger left the firm almost a year ago, while Ric Fulop recently left to form a 3D printing company. </p>

  <p class="text-info">Global private equity house KKR is reportedly nearing an imminent final close for its €3.5bn-targeting fourth European fund.</p>
  <p>The listed buyout giant had pulled in €3.2bn last month and expects to close on its target in October according to Dow Jones, which cited an unnamed person familiar with the fund. KKR launched the fundraise in the first half of 2014, and had held a €2.1bn first close by January this year, the report added. The fund follows KKR’s $4.7bn vehicle, KKR European Fund III, raised in 2008.  </p>
  <p>Dow Jones said the firm had already tapped Fund IV to back January’s acquisition of UK train ticket seller Trainline, and to pursue oil and gas investments alongside Star Energy by launching Trans European Oil & Gas (TROG). The firm revealed earlier this week that TROG planned to build a portfolio of conventional onshore oil and gas properties in proven hydrocarbon plays in Europe, and apply what it says is extensive experience in enhanced oil recovery (EOR) techniques to optimise production. </p>

  <p class="text-info">Montana Capital Partners have held a first and final close for its oversubscribed third secondary fund on its hard cap of €400m, smashing the €300m target.</p>
  <p>The fund included a GP commitment of three per cent the original target volume, with the rest coming from a small number of large institutional investors, including insurance companies, pension funds, family offices and foundations from Germany, Switzerland, the UK and Scandinavia.</p>
  <p>MCP co-founder and partner Christian Diller said, “We are very happy to continue the close relationship with our existing investors which increased their commitment volumes significantly due to the good development of the last two programmes, and are honoured to add a handful of the most reputable and sophisticated institutional investors to our exceptional investor base.”</p>

MCP will extend the investment period from one year in its previous annual secondary programs to three years for the new vehicle, targeting attractive niches of the secondary market.</p>
  <p>Marco Wulff, co-founder and partner, said, “ Our focus will remain on small and more complex secondary transactions, often sourced directly, where we work closely with the sellers to provide them with a solution tailored to their requirements. With the on-going sophistication of the secondary market, we believe that these more innovative solutions offer added value for the sellers.” In July secondaries major Coller Capital reportedly held a $3.1bn first close for its seventh flagship fund.</p>

  <p>Axiom managing partner David Benamou said, “The financial crisis resulted in a massive change in European financial regulation. “Since then, the Basel III transition and ECB regular stress testing have led banks and other institutions to increase and improve their regulatory capital, presenting new and sizeable opportunities for investors in higher-yielding debt securities.” AEFD will focus primarily on investing in the secondary market, although Axiom said it may move into primary market if it identifies attractive opportunities.</p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter3-article8"></a><h2>ADV exceeds target for pan-Asia debut with $545m final close</h2>
  <p class="text-info">Asian private equity firm ADV Partners has beaten its target for its debut pan-Asia fund by holding a $545m final close.</p>
  <p>The mid-market focused vehicle received commitments from an unnamed sovereign wealth fund, a superannuation fund, multiple US state pension programmes, fund of funds, endowments and family offices, the firm said. ADV has already tapped Opportunities Fund I for about 30 per cent of the committed capital to date, it added. The Hong Kong-headquartered firm plans to use the vehicle to invest primarily in China and India, with southeast Asia and developed Asia/Australia as opportunistic markets. </p>
  <p>It was co-founded in 2013 by Brad Landes, Suresh Prabhala and Jianyi Zhu, who worked together at Mount Kellett Capital and previously held senior management roles with the Asia principal investment platforms of JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs. The firm now has 20 professionals across its four regional offices. Eaton Partners acted as the exclusive placement agent for the fundraise.</p>
  <p>It said the vehicle was the fifth fundraise it had helped close in Asia this year, bringing its total for the region to more than $3bn. Eaton head of Asia Chris Lerner said, “Following a detailed exercise in landscaping regional managers, we concluded that ADV’s unique yet proven strategy is well suited to capitalize on inefficiencies present in Asian markets. We worked hand-in-hand with the ADV team on the fundraise and are very proud of the outcome given 2014 and 2015 have been challenging fundraising years.”  </p>
