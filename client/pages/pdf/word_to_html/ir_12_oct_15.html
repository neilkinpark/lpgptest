  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter1-article1"></a><h2>US venture-backed M&A activity hits strongest quarter this year</h2>
  <p class="text-info">Venture capital-backed M&A deals in the US hit $5.1bn in the third quarter, a 39 per cent increase on the previous three months and the strongest quarter this year, new research shows.</p>
  <p>Despite that surge, the Exit Poll Report by Thomson Reuters and the National Venture Capital Association said thirteen venture-backed IPOs raised only $1.7bn during the third quarter, a 55 per cent decrease by number of offerings from the second quarter of this year and a 54 per cent decline in total amount of dollars raised during the previous three-month period.</p>
  <p>NVCA president Bobby Franklin said, “While the number of companies making a public offering during the third quarter was down as a result of market volatility, M&A activity was robust, marking the strongest quarter by disclosed deal value this year. “Of the thirteen companies that did make an IPO, more than two-thirds are currently trading above their offering price in the middle of a choppy market, a strong indicator of the quality of venture-backed IPOs.</p>
  <p>“In addition to market volatility weighing down IPOs, another recent and important trend that has impacted the venture-backed IPO market is the increased activity of both VCs and non-traditional investors making late-stage investments into private companies that might otherwise file for an IPO. While these so-called ‘private IPOs’ are weighing down the current IPO market, it also means the venture-backed IPO pipeline is deep and we are hopeful exit activity picks up steam in future quarters.”</p>
  <p>Venture backed IPOs were led by the biotechnology sectors, with ten of the 12 offerings during the quarter life sciences-related, representing more than three-quarters of the total listings in the third quarter. A total of 11 of the quarter’s 12 IPOs were from US-based companies, with the only non-US offering coming from Austria-based Nabriva Therapeutics raising $92.3m on the NASDAQ exchange. In the largest IPO of the quarter Sunrun Inc, a California-based provider of solar energy, raised $250m and began trading on the NASDAQ stock exchange on August 4th.  </p>
  <p>The company is currently trading 26 per cent below its $14 offering price. The report said the information technology sector led the venture-backed M&A landscape in the quarter, with 69 of the 90 deals of the quarter and had a disclosed total dollar value of $3.4bn. Within this sector, computer software and services and internet specific deals accounted for the bulk of the targets with 47 and 17 transactions, respectively, across these sector subsets. out.” </p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter1-article2"></a><h2>Heinz/Kraft mega-merger helps mask private equity dealmaking slide </h2>
  <p class="text-info">US private equity dealflow continued to slide throughout the third quarter of the year despite total invested capital being boosted by the massive merger of Heinz and Kraft Foods, new research shows.</p>
  <p>Total invested capital hit $153.7bn for the quarter according to the latest report from Pitchbook, which said the Berkshire Hathaway and 3G Capital-backed Heinz/Kraft merger accounted for about $45bn of that. It said, “We view that deal as an outlier from current levels. Removing it from capital invested totals yields about $109bn across 777 deals.” That means the total value in Q3 was down more than 18 per cent relative to the $133.6bn tally of Q2, and 30 per cent on a yearly basis, again without taking the Heinz/Kraft merger into account.</p>
  <p>The total counts for the quarter were down about 13 per cent compared to the previous three months, and 19 per cent compared to the same period last year, without the merger. Pitchbook’s report said, “As we’ve noted in previous reports, the buyout resurgence of the past few years is losing fuel. Total volume is still heightened in comparison to the quarters prior to 2H 2013, yet counts have been dropping consistently in recent quarters. Capital invested through buyouts thus far into 2015 is also depressed. </p>
  <p>Public markets have begun to stutter as global economic concerns moved further into the spotlight. With that volatility and elevated valuations in both public and private markets, PE shops are increasingly wary of paying multiples that will affect their ability to control future exits. This risk-averse behaviour is beginning to enter the market, in turn driving counts, capital invested and values lower. Accordingly, investors are turning to add-on acquisitions, which have remained the preferred deal type through 2015, making up 47 per cent of all completed transactions.” </p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter1-article3"></a><h2>Co-investments double-edged sword for LP-GP relationship </h2>
  <p class="text-info">Co-investments are gaining popularity with LPs and GPs alike but they could bear risks, according to panelists at the Women’s Private Equity Network Summit.</p>
  <p>EBRD’s director of equity funds Anne Fossemalle highlighted the misalignment of interests as a key challenge. “We’ve seen some very unfortunate situations of LPs who were unable to appoint different people. So, if an LP makes a co-investment and wishes to have a nominee on the supervisory board but also, of course, is going to be a member of the LP [advisory committee] of the fund. “Whatever LP finds itself in these two situations, whenever there is a problem with the underlying company, how is the institution going to manage that?</p>
  <p>“Do investors actually have the workforce and the talent at hand to manage these two situations separately – the interest of the fund and the interest of the company?” She added, “I think it’s good that nowadays this debate is becoming much more honest and much more clear in the marketplace rather than just saying it’s fantastic to have co-investments.” Lyrique Private Equity partner Kaarina Suikkonen agreed that conflict of interest was a key issue in co-investments, but struck a positive note by saying there is more openness now between GPs and LPs as a result of co-investments.</p>
  <p>Suikkonen said her company’s experience in this regard had been entirely positive. “The managers with whom we have worked clearly have always had quite large pockets, so we were able to see that co-investments were not serving as a rationale for increasing the ticket size or moving into different market segments, but have been more part of how the GPs have done business in the past,” she said, adding that co-investments are especially important for pension funds. “It’s definitely an interesting and important topic, I think especially for the institutions, large pension funds, for whom this is a quite important and useful tool in order to reduce the field.” </p>
  <p>Vivian Liu, senior associate at M&G Investment Management, commented that despite their popularity co-investments might not always be the best option. “Analysis from the past 10-15 years shows that co-investment opportunities have pretty much been the second-tier opportunity in the GPs portfolio in terms of the track record. So, I think for LPs it’s important to be selective and make sure you are hitting on the right deals, because there could be one deal that is going to wipe off all your IRRs and returns,” she said.</p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter1-article4"></a><h2>Diversity could benefit investment strategy, WPEN 2015 panel discussion reveals</h2>
  <p class="text-info">Diversity is not a solid guarantee that an investment team will perform better, but it certainly gives it a competitive edge, delegates at the Women’s Private Equity Network Summit heard last week.</p>
  <p>Vivian Liu, senior associate at M&G Investment Management, gave an example of the consumer retail sector being an area in which women frequently have more experience that they can bring to bear on a successful investment. She said, “Being female, when you look at an investment opportunity like that you probably can do a better job or have better judgement than the men in the room, because at the end of the day a lot of women are the customers of those consumer retail products.</p>
  <p>“So, we can provide the perspective of both investor and consumer. It is not fair to say diversity equals a better result in terms of performance, but indeed increased diversity would provide a different perspective when you make investment decisions. At least, give the opportunity to reduce the risk of being overly biased,” Liu added. Kaarina Suikkonen, partner at Lyrique Private Equity, shared her views with the conference from her time as a private equity department head in a multi-asset investment house in Germany.</p>
  <p>She said, “There is a lot of discussion about women bringing different views and bringing more balanced investment decisions but there is not really hard proof on that.” EBRD’s director of Equity Funds Anne Fossemalle, meanwhile, commented on priorities. “[Diversity is] definitely something we look at and we would encourage, but the fundamental investment criteria are still going to be who is the team, what is the track record, whether they have an investment strategy that makes sense and do I have alignment of interest etc.”</p>
  <p>“We would ask the question, at LPACs, about women’s participation but we definitely cannot make this a condition. Quality is always going to be the primary concern.” Venture capital-funded companies with women on the executive team have seen a significant rise in early-stage investment, which tripled to 15 per cent in 2014 from just 5 per cent in 1999, according to a Babson College study.</p>
  <p>Businesses with a woman on the executive team are 69 per cent more likely to have higher valuations at first funding and 49 per cent more likely to be valued higher at last funding, the study found. Even so, 85 per cent of venture-capital funded businesses have no women in management and the proportion of women decision makers in the VC sector itself has nearly halved in 15 years, to 6 per cent from 10 per cent. The report, called ‘Women Entrepreneurs 2014: Bridging the Gender Gap in Venture Capital’, was the first comprehensive analysis of US venture capital investments in women entrepreneurs since 1999. ”</p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter1-article5"></a><h2>Norway-based Herkules most in-demand small European LBO manager</h2>
  <p class="text-info">Norwegian private equity firm Herkules Capital is the most popular small European buyout manager on the secondaries market, according to new research.</p>
  <p>Herkules topped the list, with Germany-based Afinum and Capiton AG taking second and third place respectively, according to Setter’s 20 Most Sought-After Small European LBO Managers on the Secondary Market report for Q3 2015. The report, which ranked managers whose most recent funds are below $500m, found that funds from the managers which made the list traded at an average of 99 per cent of NAV.</p>
  <p>Herkules invests in companies located in the Nordic region, primarily in Norway, and acquires majority interests in established businesses with strong growth potential, according to its website. Since 2004 the firm has raised funds totalling about NOK15bn (€1.6bn) and completed 100 investments so far, including add-ons and 33 platform investments.</p>
  <p>Other European small buyout firms to make the top 10 included MCH Iberian Capital, Norvestor Equity, Denmark’s Polaris, Lyceum Capital, Stirling Square Capital, Avedon Capital Partners and 21 Centrale Partners. The report is based on the Setter Liquidity Rating, which rates fund families as excellent, very good, good or unrated depending on how sought-after and saleable they are on the secondary market.</p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter1-article6"></a><h2>Q&A: Inflexion’s Gareth Healy discusses the impact of the hot exit market</h2>
  <p class="text-info">Following a series of strong exits for Europe-focused Inflexion Private Equity, partner Gareth Healy offers his perspective on how the hot exit market has led to higher multiples on the way out but means they have to be more selective and more disciplined on the way in.</p>
  <p>Having offloaded a number of portfolio companies this year, now must be a good time for the exit market? The exit market is strong, and we have assets in which there has been a lot of interest from trade, private equity and also the public markets. So effectively what is happening is an acceleration of some of our hold periods to take advantage of that. If you look at something like On the Beach, which was only held for 23 months, given the strong interest from the public markets we realised we could do a partial realisation quite early and then ride the upside of the public market for longer. As you know it’s a good market right now so we are getting some attractive valuations for our businesses.</p>
  <p>Why is the market so strong? There is a lot of money around, public markets have been positive, private equity has good levels of cash to deploy, and there is competition for the best assets. Hopefully we have chosen good companies, and we have found that when we have put our companies in a process there has been a lot of interest.</p>
  <p>Inflexion has achieved some impressive multiples, how does the firm enhance a company to achieve the best value-add? A lot of it is about trying to find the contributors of growth to the business and try to get behind them. Inflexion is unique in that we have offices in India, China and Brazil which are designed to help our companies accelerate in those territories and our local guys can sometimes act as sales people as well as helping them cut through local red tape and regulation.</p>
  <p>We also have quite an active house in style. Some PE firms are more passive, but we are very driven to maximise the value of the business. We recognise however, that as much as a PE firm tries to help, it is good and ambitious management teams with well positioned businesses that really drive superior returns. A hot market means we are benefitting from good multiples on the way out but it also means on the way in we have to be very selective and disciplined.</p>
  <p>It is only appropriate to pay a full price for a business if it is niche, high quality and has great potential. We are very selective about the businesses we focus on, the structures we invest in and seek downside protections in the situations we assess. You have to be very disciplined and careful when investing in these markets.</p>
  <p>How does the US IPO market compare to that of the UK? There are various risks associated with floating businesses in the US which has been repeated over the last couple of decades for UK companies. You can quite easily become an orphan stock as the US is so large, the businesses need to have a certain market cap to get attention. If you’re a little foreign, a little different or remote then you are competing with a lot of other local companies in the US. Often those smaller companies floating in the US haven’t had sufficient liquidity, especially in a downturn, and it hasn’t worked for them.</p>
  <p>Is there any sector in particular which has given you the best returns? We have just had an extraordinary week where we completed three TMT deals in a week, we agreed to sel lIdeal Shopping Direct, floated On the Beach and backed Mobica. So far TMT has been a great sector for us and we have had some of our best deals there. If you look back 18 months we have had other good exits in the sector such as FDM Group plc at 16.2-times and more recently Reward Gateway at 7.7-times.</p>
  <p>As a result we are getting very good returns out of the TMT sector and we have a lot of specialist knowledge on it. It has favourable characteristics with ongoing technological changes;there are many high growth companies with international potential, well suited to the Inflexion growth strategy. We are already active in the sector and I think you will see us becoming ever more so.</p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter1-article7"></a><h2>Emerging markets join developed in increasingly sticky IPO activity</h2>
  <p class="text-info">Emerging markets IPO activity suffered a sharp slowdown in the third quarter following stellar results in the preceding three-month period, new research suggests.</p>
  <p>China in particular stuttered following a strong Q2, triggered by a sharp market correction and suspension of new listings, professional services firm EY said in its latest Global IPO Trends report. It said that in developed markets IPOs remained depressed on the back of significant market volatility, although it added that indications were that activity would pick up in the final quarter of the year. The total number of global IPOs (192) and the proceeds raised ($17.9bn) in Q3 were down on the previous quarter by 55 per cent and 75 per cent respectively.</p>
  <p>While the first nine months of 2015 had marginally more listings than the first nine months of 2014 (up two per cent), global IPO proceeds are now down 32 per cent on the same period last year. EY said this was due, in part, to the absence of Chinese IPO deal flow and the on-going shift toward smaller average deal sizes. It added that even excluding the Alibaba IPO, global proceeds in Q3 were 58 per cent lower than the same period last year. </p>
  <p>Maria Pinelli, EY’s global vice chair for strategic growth markets, said, “The prospects for the IPO market for the remainder of the year and beyond rest on investor confidence. Good news seems to be mixed with bad, which has led to this stop-start market. Volatility has impacted different markets at different times of the year, from worries surrounding Greece and stock market turbulence in Asia, to recent uncertainty over US interest rates.</p>
  <p>“If developed markets can withstand the uncertainty and volatility reduces, we’d expect IPO activity to pick up again in the last quarter, with our teams on the ground reporting very healthy levels of activity in the pipeline.” With 466 IPOs raising US$57.8bn through the first nine months of the year, EY said that Asia-Pacific continues to be the leading region, both in terms of deal number and proceeds. However, IPO activity saw a sharp contraction in Q3 with 101 IPOs raising $8.4bn, compared to 218 IPOs raising $34.9bn in the second quarter of 2015.</p>
  <p>That represented a 25 per cent drop in number of deals and a 43 per cent drop in proceeds compared to the same quarter in 2014. It added that Japan was on course for 100 IPOs by the end of 2015, which would be the best year since 2007. Pinelli said, “The IPO market in Asia-Pacific is entering a period of uncertainty. With further IPOs unlikely on Chinese exchanges this year, overall deal volume in the fourth quarter will be down.</p>
  <p>“However, while investors in ASEAN markets are pulling back, companies are continuing to list in the more mature markets. Japan is on course for a record year and activity looks set to pick up again in Australia in the fourth quarter. Although mainland China has already seen more stock exchange listings in 2015 than in the whole of 2014, the outlook for the region to the end of the year is mixed.”</p>

  <p class="text-info">Private equity and pension fund-backed Acelity Holdings is looking to raise up to $1bn in its upcoming IPO, AltAssets understands.</p>
  <p>The medical technology company, which is backed by Apax Partners, PSP Investments and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, intends to list on the New York Stock Exchange according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. However the filing doesn’t indicate the number of shares it will be offering or their expected price. Acelity filed for an offering in August and is reportedly looking to use the IPO proceeds to repay its debt according to Thomson Reuters.</p>
  <p>The Texas-based company, which was founded in 1976 as Kinetic Concepts, develops regenerative medicine and sells health care products. In October 2001, a consortium comprised of Apax Partners, CPPIB and the PSP Investments, purchased KCI for $68.50 per common share in cash, or a total value of approximately $6.3bn according to the private equity firms website. In August, AltAssets reported that Ares Management and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board were looking to exit Neiman Marcus via an IPO. </p>

  <p class="text-info">Swiss investment firm Partners Group has purchased three stakes in a buyout fund managed by European private equity firm IK Investment Partners.</p>
  <p>Finland’s government pensions institution Keva sold Partners its stakes in Industri Kapital 2000 LP I, Industri Kapital 2000 LP II and Industri Kapital 2000 LP IV according to a trio of UK regulatory filings. All three vehicles are part of IK 2000 Fund, which closed on €2.1bn in November 2001 according to Secondaries Investor, which cited a spokesperson.</p>
  <p>IK partner Dan Soudry did not respond to a request for comment. Partners bought the stakes through its Partners Group Barrier Reef Access 7, Partners Group Private Equity and Partners Group Falcon Access vehicles.

  <P class="text-info">TPG Real Estate, the property investment arm of US private equity major TPG, has closed its first dedicated fund above target with more than $2bn in commitments.</p>
  <p>Fundraising for TPG Real Estate Partners II (TREP II) started in early 2014, with the firm hoping to hit up to $2bn through the vehicle. TPG began making real estate investments in 2009, and has provided more than $3bn of equity in residential as well as commercial properties in North America and Europe. Those deals came through capital from its main buyout funds and specialist separate accounts with individual LPs.</p>
  <p>TPG co-founder Jim Coulter said, “Exceeding the target for TREP II is a testament to the momentum of both the real estate team and TPG.” The high-risk real estate fund was backed by public and private pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, insurance companies, and other institutional investors. Kelvin Davis, founder and co-head of TPG Real Estate, said, “Building on our growth over the past six years, we are looking forward to investing the fund successfully.”</p>
  <p>Avi Banyasz, partner at TPG and co-head of TPG Real Estate, added, “TREP II will continue to implement our differentiated investment strategy focused on real estate platforms and property-rich companies that leverages our broader capabilities to optimize property performance and enhance platform capabilities.” </p>

  <P class="text-info">US alternative assets major Black Diamond Capital Management has closed its fourth fund on its $1.5bn hard cap, AltAssets understands.</p>
  <p>The firm said BDCM Opportunity Fund IV substantially exceeded its original target, which was reported to be around $1bn. Black Diamond founder and managing principal Steve Deckoff, said, “We are very pleased to have exceeded our expectations during this fundraise and are especially thankful to our current investors for their significant support.</p>
  <p>“We are also very appreciative of the trust and confidence a significant group of new investors, representing some of the largest pension plans, insurance companies and sovereign wealth funds investing in private equity today, have placed in our firm and strategy.” The fund will seek to buy middle-market U.S. and European based companies, typically through a restructuring or reorganization process.</p>
  <p>The new vehicle is the firm’s latest fundraise to date, outstripping the $800m it gathered for its predecessor vehicle in 2011 and the $982m it collected for its second fund in 2007. Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC acted as a placement agent for Fund IV, and Schulte Roth & Zabel provided legal advice. </p>

  <P class="text-info">Canadian mid-market investor Brookfield Asset Management will spin off around 35 per cent of its PE subsidiary Brookfield Business Partners (BBP) via a special dividend.</p>
  <p>The firm has announced it will distribute among existing shareholders around $0.50 per share, or some $500m, in the form of units of BBP. BBP will initially incorporate all of Brookfield’s business services and industrial operations. These businesses generated approximately $200m of funds from operations for Brookfield last year and had an equity value of $2bn as at end-June 2015, the group said.</p>
  <p>Cyrus Madon, CEO of BBP and a senior managing partner of Brookfield, head of group PE operations, said “Brookfield Business Partners will accomplish for our business services and industrial operations what our other flagship public issuers have successfully accomplished for our property, renewable energy and infrastructure operations – providing a focused listed owner to support the expansion of these businesses.” Brookfield started this year with plans of raising its fourth mid-market fund, targeting $3.5bn. </p>

  <P class="text-info">Life science-focused private equity firm Aisling Capital Partners has placed a $400m target on its fourth fund, AltAssets can reveal.</p>
  <p>Aisling Capital IV is yet to receive any commitments according to a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The filing does however indicate that Sagent Advisors has been brought on board to push the vehicle out to LPs, with sales commission priced at $3.5m. Fund IV comes over six years after the firm closed its predecessor, Aisling Capital III, on $650m.</p>
  <p>Aisling will likely follow the same strategy as Fund III, by investing primarily in companies developing pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and medical products, as well as in businesses that provide services to the healthcare industry. Since 2000, the New York-based firm has raised over $1.6bn in committed capital across three funds according to its website. In April, Venrock and Aisling Capital led a $18.5m Series B funding round for Taiwan-based medical device maker Spirox. </p>

  <P class="text-info">Venture debt capital firm Wellington Financial has launched its fifth fund with a $300m hard cap of re-circulating equity commitments, AltAssets understands.</p>
  <p>Wellington, which provides growth capital to Canadian and US-based companies, announced the fund as part of the launch of a new $900m investment program. Fund V is targeted to bring in 50 per cent more than Wellington Financial Fund IV, which capitalised with $200m of re-circulating equity capital in 2012. Fund IV went on to commit more than $225m via 28 growth capital transactions over a three-year period according to the firm.</p>
  <p>The new vehicle has already held a first close earlier this week, and while it is unclear how much it has raised to date, the firm said Fund V is already well on its way to reaching its hard cap of $300m. Mark McQueen, Wellington Financial’s president and CEO, said, “We are honoured to have earned the sustained confidence of institutional investors, entrepreneurs and their venture capital partners.” This new fund positions our firm to provide entrepreneurs with anywhere from $2m to $40m of growth capital per company. </p>

  <P class="text-info">The corporate private equity arm of Rothschild Merchant Banking has closed its second fund above target at €775m due to “substantial oversubscription”.</p>
  <p>Five Arrows Principal Investments (FAPI) said the original target for the European lower mid-market vehicle was €700m. FAPI added that it enjoyed high support from existing LPs in its first FAPI fund and other Rothschild funds. A big number of new investors also joined the FAPI II fundraising. Those were “blue-chip institutions and major family offices around the globe”.</p>
  <p>Rothschild told AltAssets the new investors came mainly from Europe, Asia and the US. FAPI co-managing partner Javed Khan said, “The loyalty of our existing investors and strength of demand from new investors for FAPI II is a terrific endorsement of our investment strategy to invest in high-quality, robust business franchises with a demonstrated track record of delivering attractive returns on invested capital across economic cycles. As was the case in FAPI I, we intend to focus primarily on generating proprietary investment opportunities and acquiring businesses outside of auction processes.” </p>
  <p>Emmanuel Roth, co-managing partner of FAPI added, “We are convinced that our local, grass-roots access in each of the key European countries is a major competitive advantage of FAPI for both deal sourcing as well as creating operational value during our period of ownership. By leveraging Rothschild & Co’s extensive pan-European network of industry operators, we hope to continue to build our position as a partner of choice for both entrepreneurs and talented management teams in our core target markets.”</p>
  <p>In March 2015, FAPI held the first close for its second fund, raising €508m.

It is also a great milestone for Aberdeen’s expanded presence in private market solutions, and more broadly in alternatives, and we appreciate the support of our limited partners.” </p>

  <P class="text-info">UK-based Octopus Ventures, the venture capital arm of the Octopus Group, has launched a $140m fund to invest in later-stage businesses across Europe.</p>
  <p>Octopus Zenith Opportunities II has already made its first investment, joining forces with Google Ventures in July to lead a $60m financing round in luxury travel site Secret Escapes. Octopus aims to invest in companies already part of its portfolio as well as fast-growing news businesses. The group’s funds will pour between £250,000 and £25m into fast-growing European companies. </p>
  <p>Alex Macpherson, head of Octopus Ventures, said, “We are often one of the first investors into a startup and have long felt comfortable investing at the very earliest stage of a company’s life. </p>
  <p>“It’s a long term partnership and we want to be there supporting the management team as they continue to realise the full potential of their businesses during the course of its lifetime, working to achieve growth for the team, the company and our own investors.”</p>
  <p>“As the European ecosystem continues to develop and mature, this $140m fund allows Octopus to continue backing talented entrepreneurs from an early stage, but then to provide crucial on-going support, remaining an investment partner as they go on to build big, enduring businesses.” Octopus has a solid track record of supporting businesses that had achieved global success really quickly. Among its investments are Zoopla Property Group, SwiftKey and graze.com. </p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter3-article18"></a><h2>New Octopus fund will target gap in European market, exec says </h2>
  <P class="text-info">UK-based Octopus Ventures is closing a loophole in the European market with its new $140m second fund, the firm’s head Alex Macpherson told AltAssets.</p>
  <p>Octopus announced the final close of its Octopus Zenith Opportunities II at $140m yesterday. The fund has already invested in luxury travel site Secret Escapes, joining forces with Google Ventures in July to lead a $60m financing round. Targeting later-stage investments in fast-growing European businesses, the fund will “address a gap” according to Macpherson, as there is currently a lack of available capital for successful organisations looking to scale their business.</p>
  <p>He said, “There has been a lack of capital for that, really scaling the business, and a lack of capital for these high-growth businesses. In a small way that is a part we are looking to address with this new fund.” He continued, “This fund is very much a complement to the funds we currently have in place. So, we can continue to back those exceptionally talented entrepreneurs who are building great businesses and for us to continue to maintain that relationship and take those investments forward.</p>
  <p>“Secret Escapes is a good example of having had that relationship and having seen how the business has developed and as it moves through the growth stages how it has been applicable to this fund.”</p>
  <p>The new fund was backed by existing as well as new investors, predominantly funds of funds, Macpherson told AltAssets. He said, “In terms of the fundraising we were pleasantly surprised by the environment.</p>
  <p>“I think one of the attractions of the fund for the LPs was the fact that this was a fund that is predominantly looking at businesses coming from our venture portfolio, that are growing quickly and the fact that the relationship we have with those entrepreneurs is in place. And really it’s the fact that the business is growing beyond the fund mandate of our early-stage venture funds. European entrepreneurs are looking to scale their businesses on a global basis.”</p>
  <p>Commenting on the £250,000 to £25m range the firm said it will be targeting for investments, Macpherson said, “Just to clarify, we as a house are now a multi-stage investor and are able to invest across that range. “Clearly, just a small investment of a few hundred thousand pounds would be applied from the venture funds. The Opportunities Fund is looking to write substantially larger checks, £7m to £25m-type checks.” </p>
  <p>The European market’s ability to build global businesses is being currently reinforced and Europe can now measure up to other markets, Macpherson said, adding that the market environment at the moment is “encouraging” thanks to more backing from the US. He said, “We have seen over the last few years a number of US investors making investments into European companies as they look to scale, and I think that is exemplified by Google’s investment in Secret Escapes.” Europe is now “wonderfully positioned” to take advantage from opportunities in the US but also look for new opportunities in Asia, he added.</p>
  <p>The market in Europe has also evolved since Octopus’ last fundraising. Macpherson explained, “The entrepreneurial league system in Europe has seen huge change over the last few years, with entrepreneurs in the angel-investing community, a number of seed and early-stage funds are being created in Europe, and predominantly across the main hubs like London, Berlin, Stockholm, but also Paris. “What we need to see in Europe is that system being built across the various stages.” </p>
