  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter1-article1"></a><h2>SEC accuses two of insider trading prior to PE acquisitions</h2>
  <p class="text-info">The US Securities and Exchange Commission has filed insider trading charges against two Chinese citizens ahead of the acquisition of two healthcare companies.</p>
  <p>It has accused Zhichen Zhou, a web administrator at Yooli.com, of using funds provided by his cousin, Yannan Liu, to trade illegally. Liu was formerly employed by TPG Capital, a private equity firm which bid for both MedAssets and Chindex. The SEC alleges that Liu provided the non-public information about the acquisitions to Zhou, resulting in profits of approximately $300,000.</p>
  <p>Earlier this month, Pamplona Capital Management tapped Fund IV to acquire US healthcare performance company MedAssets for $31.35 per share. While in early 2014, Chindex was taken private by a consortium including TPG in y a $369m deal.</p>
  <p>The SEC believes that Zhou illegally profited from trades in Chindex International based on information provided by Liu and made $900,000 in purchases of MedAssets, which represented more than four times his stated net worth.these funds entails much more risk but also the potential for much greater returns. A well-diversified microfund only needs a home run or two and a few singles—and in their case, a home run is in the range of the median exit values we saw previously.” </p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter1-article2"></a><h2>European mid-market raising stability masking dwindling fundraise numbers</h2>
  <p class="text-info">Considerable private equity capital raising in the European mid-market is masking a dwindling number of fund closes, new research suggests.</p>
  <p>Pooled commitments have stabilised recently, with the third quarter bringing $22bn to take the yearly total to the end of September to almost $42bn according to the latest Pitchbook European Middle Market report. But despite a flattening out of fundraising activity following the plunge from the mid-2000s heyday, this year has seen just 54 pools of capital close, putting it on pace to record the lowest total in a decade.</p>
  <p>The report said, “By and large, even if capital raised is considerable, the dwindling number of vehicles closed is telling, because even though dealmaking is ever more heavily concentrated in the European MM, PE firms are likely still burning off the dry powder amassed in previous years.</p>
  <p>“That bump in collected commitments across so few vehicles, as well as the spike in average MM fund size, however, underlines what we’ve been hearing for some time – in today’s environment, those raising funds tend to be well-proven and experienced, not to mention big. Bridgepoint, The Carlyle Group, PAI Partners, Montagu Private Equity—these are just a few of the firms that have already closed large funds in 2015.</p>
  <p>“Even so, such historically successful fund managers have taken longer to close on capital pools than in the past few years. Especially when it comes to as uncertain an investment prospect as Europe currently is, many of the larger LPs are understandably cautious, whittling down the number of fund managers they will entrust with their capital even more than they are globally.”</p>
  <p>Pitchbook said that given the current economic conditions on the continent it made sense that more than three-quarters of all PE pools closed through the end of Q3 had been earmarked for buyouts. It added, “The European Middle Market still presents plenty of opportunity, more so in some regions than others, even in what may be a prolonged period of sluggish growth.</p>
  <p>“But it’s not just buyout shops closing funds—there has been a steady trickle of mezzanine and restructuring funds closing over the past couple years. The emergence of alternative sources of lending as European banks pull away from risk has become an ever-strengthening narrative, with asset managers helping fill the gap by offering loans at high interest rates.</p>
  <p>“Consequently, the €3.6 billion raised for mezzanine vehicles in 2015 through the end of 3Q—well over 10 per cent of all capital raised—could be just the first sign of more and more fundraising focused on supplying private debt, depending on how much that trend accelerates. Looking forward, the uncertainty surrounding the European scene is what suggests that it will be more of the same – experienced GPs that have demonstrated prior ability raising primarily traditional buyout and debt vehicles.” </p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter1-article3"></a><h2>PE’s ‘hands-on approach’ ideal for unlocking ‘huge untapped potential’ of transition markets: EBRD</h2>
  <p class="text-info">Private equity accounts for just a fraction of investments in the so-called transition markets at the moment but there is a huge untapped future potential there, the EBRD’s latest Transition Report shows.</p>
  <p>The report says private equity has had a strikingly positive impact on employment and physical investment across the transition region, including Central and South-East Europe, the Baltic countries, the Southern and Eastern Mediterranean and Central Asia. “Equity investment enables shareholders to adopt a long-term and hands-on approach in their investee companies, fostering sound corporate governance and transparency, making appropriate contributions to business strategy and optimising management,” the report says.</p>
  <p>Huge untapped potential</p>
  <p>While in developed economies PE is more focused on restructuring mature businesses, in the transition region private equity funds are predominantly targeting credit-constrained businesses which have the potential to grow in the future. To unlock that potential, investors apply various strategies for operational improvement which over time create tremendous value for the businesses. Companies with PE investors have performed better in terms of productivity and job growth in the long term. An average 30 additional jobs are created by each company in the EBRD region that gets PE investments.</p>
  <p>The EBRD sees a huge unutilised potential in the transition region with 40,000 businesses considered suitable targets for PE investors and the volume of additional PE capital the region could potentially attract standing at $30.5bn. The big question is how to untap it.</p>
  <p>Policy makers can help while waiting for growth to return</p>
  <p>Hans Peter Lankes, EBRD’s acting chief economist, presenting the highlights of the report said there are two specific factors the reports zooms in on – corporate governance and exit opportunities. Increasing the amount of private equity financing in the EBRD region is dependent on the growth prospects there, so a strong recovery will boost private equity flows, the report says. However, local policy makers can also impact PE flows if the take more measures to protect minority shareholders and work on the further development of public equity markets.</p>
  <p>“The establishment of specialist stock exchanges for SMEs that reduce listing costs and the regulatory burden can improve access to equity financing,” the report suggests.</p>
  <p>Region-specific challenges to higher PE penetration </p>
  <p>Thierry Baudon, founder and managing partner of CEE-focused private equity firm Mid Europa Partners, put things in perspective by outlining the key barriers to PE currently effective in the region. He pointed out that while Central and Eastern Europe is of course affected by circular stagnation, inflation, globalisation, technology, demographics, those are issues that go beyond the confines of the region. However, there are several factors specific to the CEE region which prevent the expansion of private equity here.</p>
  <p>Nature of the deal flow</p>
  <p>“The first one has to do with the nature of the deal flow. There was a period in the early years where the combination of several factors such as privatisation, some greenfield investments, for example in telecoms, provided a lot of volume and then everything went through a slump. Pretty much from the point when the financial crisis struck. Now what we see coming out is a completely different phase with a number of companies, created in the early 1990s by local entrepreneurs, at the stage where succession issues and exit issues are going to pan out.</p>
  <p>“And this local Mittelstand is actually going to provide another wave of opportunities which will be very good from economic standpoint because you want those mid-sized companies to grow to the next stage and the report makes a credible case that going cross-border will help increase size. So, the reason I am optimistic is because I can see the sort of deal flow coming out that did not exist before. “</p>
  <p>Lack of intermediaries and secondary market</p>
  <p>“Another reason for the low penetration of PE in the region is that it is very little served by intermediaries and this has been the case for a long time and it does not change. There are very few investment banks in permanent position in the region. The third thing is that there basically is no secondary market in PE in CEE. </p>
  <p>“There are companies which have went through PE hands six times in a row. That makes volume. We need to reconstruct our stock all the time. To give you a Mid Europa example – we had 22 exits in our portfolio, 18 of which went to trade buyers and when they buy an asset they do not put in back on the market for years. So, we need to reconstitute our stock, which is very time consuming. “</p>
  <p>Stock exchanges as competitors </p>
  <p>“The competition with some stock exchanges could be another impediment for PE. While it may sound like a paradox for a PE investor to complain about stock exchanges but many small businesses may prefer to go public than private enticed by more regulatory protection and more short-term returns.</p>
  <p>“The way privatisation has been done in the region over the years has seen many global companies take over most of the manufacturing assets very early on – in the 1990s. All sectors are out of the PE reach, so where PE invests at the moment is in services and very little in manufacturing. In many countries of the CEE region the space accessible to PE is limited compared to what is being offered in Western Europe.”</p>
  <p>Optimism despite regional constraints</p>
  <p>Even if the markets in the CEE region have a lot of catching up to do in terms of private equity. There is a lot of factors pointing to a successful outcome. As it is long-term in nature one should take a look at PE in a long-term perspective. Baudon said, “While the combination of all these region-specific factors makes for a slower progress of PE in CEE this will change in the future.</p>
  <p>“I have been investing in these markets since the mid-1980s, so this gives me the long-term perspective. Frankly, we have witnessed much worse periods. If you look any deeper you see that this very low level of investment actually hides pretty high investment inflows in particular sectors which tend to be the ones experiencing very fast growth, consolidation.</p>
  <p>“Very often those are sectors which are highly-fragmented and start to consolidate. And, those are sectors that tend to be focused on anything that serves the middle class urban consumer. That is where the investments are going and there is a lot of money going there. If I look at the top of the entire Mid Europa portfolio for 2014/2015 we are 3-4x the average GDP growth of this region. So there is investment going on.</p>
  <p>“The numbers in the report do not look great but overall the fundamentals in the CEE countries are good. Considering what is on the ground in the sub-regions I am most familiar with and those are the CEE and SEE markets, I am optimistic. I’m actually more optimistic than the report suggests. With more than €4bn of equity poured in those sub-regions so far, I am prepared to double up.”</p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter1-article4"></a><h2>Israel PE dealmaking in Q3 more than 40% below five-year average</h2>
  <p class="text-info">Israeli private equity dealmaking dropped to $419m in the third quarter of the year, more than 40 per cent below the five-year quarterly average.</p>
  <p>Dealflow was down heavily on the exceptionally high $1.6bn from the second quarter according to research by the IVC research centre and law firm Shibfolet & Co. The five-year quarterly average currently stands at $738m, which Q3 was well below despite reaching an average number of deals made.</p>
  <p>IVC and Shibolet’s report said that despite the substantial quarter-over-quarter fluctuations, the Q1 to Q3 2015 period turned out to be the most successful three-quarter span in Israeli private equity performance, with nearly $2.5bn invested in 66 transactions. Those figures are higher than the $2.3bn invested in 60 deals in the first nine months of 2014, or the $1.7bn in 58 investments during the same period of 2013.</p>
  <p>In the first nine months of 2015 Israeli private equity funds invested $672m, or 27 per cent of the total. That was a 24 percent increase, compared with $543m (24 per cent) invested in the same term in 2014. The research said the three largest deals over this period were buyout transactions, which accounted for 30 per cent of Israeli PE fund investments. Topping the table was the $97m buyout of Hadera Paper by FIMI in Q2. </p>
  <p>IVC and Shibolet said that while foreign private equity funds maintained their activity levels in terms of number of transactions, the volume of investments dropped to just 29 per cent of total deal-making in Q3 2015, compared with 81 per cent in Q2 and 84 per cent in Q3 last year – the two strongest quarters for foreign PE activity in Israel.</p>
  <p>Omer Ben-Zvi, partner at Shibolet & Co, said, “On the one hand, it can’t be denied that private equity investments in the third quarter of 2015 were relatively low. “This fact may be attributed to the volatility in capital markets in recent months, which is crucial when large deals in late stage companies are concerned. On the other hand, it’s important to note that the number of deals and volumes are very similar to those of the first quarter of the year, with the entire period constituting an especially strong first three quarters.</p>
  <p>“Therefore, I wouldn’t conclude that the trend is turning, or that the Israeli private equity market is weakening simply based on the third quarter results. It is too early to conclude a down trend based on a single quarter, partly because the survey figures are strongly impacted by single large-size deals. Such deals are always few, but make up a sizable portion in capital investment.</p>
  <p>“It is also important to note that PE deals often take around six months to close.”</p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter1-article5"></a><h2>First-time funds can be winners</h2>
  <p class="text-info">Private equity performance is not as persistent as it once was. And, with many established GPs having had a bad crisis, is it time LPs took a closer look at first-time funds?</p>
  <p>On 9 June 2015, New York-based private equity firm Sycamore Partners closed its second fund at its hard cap of $2.5bn. The fundraising had taken less than three months and the close came two years to the day after Sycamore had closed its maiden fund on $1bn. The success shows that institutional investors have an appetite for first-time funds, and the second fund saw existing and new LPs up their commitments.</p>
  <p>“We are grateful for the positive and enthusiastic response we have received from our existing and new limited partners,” said Stefan Kaluzny, a managing director of Sycamore Partners, in the terse press release that accompanied the news. “We continue to focus on our historically successful investment strategy of partnering with the very best consumer and retail executives to acquire and improve the very best consumer and retail brands.”</p>
  <p>LPs generally fall into two camps when it comes to firsttime funds: those that can’t and those that have to. While some are barred by their fund terms from taking on the perceived additional risk, others either have a mandate to support first-time funds or a dedicated pot of money for them. Funds of funds are an important source of capital for first-time GPs.</p>
  <p>“We’ll always look,” says a managing director at a global fund of funds. “The paradigm is first-time funds are a lot easier than first-time groups. If it’s something that’s come out from another organisation where the structure is the same, it’s just that they’re shifting the nameplate, we’re more comfortable. What we’re more nervous about – and on the basis of the facts, right to be so – is people coming together from four different points of the compass. Historically that’s not been a brilliant recipe for success.”</p>
  <p>Performance of first-time funds is more variable, as you would expect. The chances of it going seriously wrong are higher, but so are the chances of getting an outsize return. “We’ve had a mixed experience,” says Geoffrey Love, head of venture capital and equity long/short-investments at the Wellcome Trust, a big LP. “We’ve been disappointed more frequently with first-time funds than we have investing in established groups. When we do it, it’s because we get very excited about the combination of team and space the fund’s going to exploit.”</p>
  <p>Investors make the distinction between first-time funds and first-time groups, with the former much more likely to be supported. “If you look at the US, things have gone horrifically wrong when the team blows apart and you don’t have the shared experience of working together in a constructive way,” says a fund-of-funds manager, who asked not to be named. “You just double up on the risk. We’re more likely to go forward to the system when it’s a spin-out.”</p>
  <p>The message for first-time groups is that you better have a very, very compelling proposition if you want to overcome investor reluctance. “The things that sinks many first-time funds are either operational risks or personnel risks,” says Love. “A lot of VCs will say: ‘I just want to invest, I want to do what I’m passionate about and I want to invest money’. But really you’re going to be running an organisation on your own now, you’re going to have to split your time no matter whether you want to or not. You are going to be running a business. And you’re going to have to devote quite a bit of your time and attention away from investing, and not doing that is such a common mistake. It’s almost wilful oversight from some people.”</p>
  <p>A new generation of fund managers including Sycamore, Altamont Capital Partners, Revelstoke Capital Partners, Huntsman-Lion Capital, Augusta Columbia Capital, Atlas, Garnett Theis Capital, Broadsky Partners, DC Capital Partners, Ridgemont Equity Partners, OpenGate Capital and CenterOak Partners, have gone on to raise substantially bigger funds. “In the United States in the last two to three years there has been a very high number of them, all spinouts, and if you track them they’ve been incredibly successful,” says Mounir Guen, CEO at placement advisor MVision. “If you look at their performance and the support they’ve got and the work that they’ve done, they’ve been absolutely fantastic. These general partners are very, very focused. You’re dealing with very specific model plans, very specific sector speciality, a very specific type of targeted companies.”</p>
  <p>The nature of first-time funds varies by geography. In the US it is mostly spin-outs from established groups. Europe has seen fewer first-time funds, where the additional regulatory complexity of the Alternative Investment Funds Management Directive (AIFMD) may be a barrier. In Latin America there is rapid growth of smaller funds, while Africa is seeing a lot of DFIsupported funds setting up.</p>
  <p>Developing markets</p>
  <p>Asia-Pacific has its own dynamic. “In Asia Pacific a lot of first-time funds are coming to market,” says Guen. “There they are a little more mixed in type. You have family groups that are institutionalising part of their businesses, you’ve got bankers that are creating new funds and you’ve got spinouts.” Developing markets are more of a challenge, mainly because the private equity market itself needs to be developed.</p>
  <p>“In emerging markets, because the activity is fairly new, a lot of funds are conceptual,” adds Guen. “They come in and say: ‘We believe our economy is going to triple in size and there’s going to be this change in the middle class and there’s going to be the following changes that are going to occur. As a result of that we believe we can make great returns for you’. That’s a bit of a leap of faith.”</p>
  <p>Part of the leap is in identifying and backing the managers of the future. “Sometimes, a PE firm’s first ideas are its best ideas, and the performance of the first fund reflects that,” says Hugh MacArthur, head of private equity at consultants Bain & Company. “Secondly, as funds become more popular, they tend to become oversubscribed, and getting placement with the ones that are successful can be challenging. Securing your spot as a cornerstone supporter of a fund early on could mean that you get the allocation you want in the third, fourth or fifth fund – something that’s less likely to happen if you take a ‘wait and see’ approach.”</p>
  <p>Even Love, who has had a less than positive experience, will still look at first-time vehicles. “I don’t think it’s something that any investor should exclude from their portfolio,” he says “I don’t think it’s worth giving a blanket ‘no’ because in a couple of instances we’ve been very lucky with first-time funds fund.  </p>

  <p class="text-info">The California Public Employees’ Retirement System has sold $3bn worth of secondary real estate fund interests to Strategic Partners Fund Solutions.</p>
  <p>Strategic Partners, Blackstone’s dedicated secondary and private market fund solutions business, acquired the interests, in what it says is the industry’s largest secondary transaction to date. CalPERS’ has sold 43 international and domestic funds from its non-strategic real estate portfolio as it looks to actively manage its private markets portfolio.</p>
  <p>Mark Burton, head of Strategic Partners’ real estate business said, “This is a marquee transaction for the real estate secondaries industry. Given our significant real estate experience developed through over 100 real estate secondary transactions since 2001, and our strong coverage of the 43 funds in this transaction, we were able to execute a complex transaction in a relatively short amount of time.” Last month, Strategic Partners purchased a stake in Amadeus Capital’s second fund. </p>

  <p class="text-info">US private equity major Welsh Carson Anderson & Stowe is within a whisker of $3bn in its twelfth flagship fundraise, AltAssets can reveal.</p>
  <p>The firm has registered just over $2.9bn for Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe XII according to an updated filing with the US securities regulator. More than $300m of that has been collected in a parallel Cayman Islands vehicle from five investors, the filing adds. New York-based Welsh Carson has raised more than $21bn since it was founded in 1979. The firm specialises in investments in healthcare, information and business-services companies.</p>
  <p>Welsh Carson says its investment strategy is “deal-size agnostic, which allows [it] to invest in the most attractive risk-return opportunities identified in its two target industries,” according to its website. Its current portfolio companies include Oxford Finance, Universal American, GetWellNetwork, AIM Software, Alert Logic and Paycom.</p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter3-article2"></a><h2>Ridgemont closes Fund II on $995M hard cap</h2>
  <p class="text-info">Despite a competitive fundraising environment, Ridgemont Equity Partners has closed its second fund at its $995M hard cap, after just seven months on the road according to partner John Shimp. </p>
  <p>REPII, which began fundraising in March 2015 with a target of $900m, announced a first close of $750m in June. The fund received the majority of the capital from existing investors, with most increasing their commitments, along with significant interest from new investors.</p>
  <p>It collected cheques from both public and private pension funds, asset aggregators, and a few insurance companies. Ridgemont also made a substantial commitment to the fund. Shimp told AltAssets, “The market is pretty competitive as there is a record number of funds out there. So while we were fortunate to have a really good set of LPs and a lot of re ups, there was defiantly band width issues out in the market.</p>
  <p>“A lot of LPs were working on different things, so when we got past the perspectives a lot said ‘we really like to spend the time but we just don’t have the time’. We are middle market, a little bit more on the lower mid-market side of things, and I feel this was that was very helpful. There are a lot of firms of all shapes and sizes but it felt like we had a little bit more of a positive reception then maybe some of the other segments of the markets. Good players do well in all segments, but I feel that was a little bit of strength for us.”</p>
  <p>The fund’s predecessor, which closed in 2012 on $750m, is nearly fully invested according to Shimp, and to date has exited four out of the 16 portfolio companies. He added, “The exit environment is good. Valuations over here are high and financing is still readily available, although it might have soften a little, but it’s still really available so it’s a good time to be exiting companies. We have had a really good past 12 months for, we have returned around $500m in capital. We are trying the best we can to take advantage of the environment.”</p>
  <p>The investment strategies for REP II remain consistent with REP I according to the firm. It will focus on buyout and growth capital investments of $25m to $100m in four industries, basic industries and services, energy, healthcare, and telecommunications. </p>
  <p>Shimp said, “We have individuals who have been emerged in those industries for decades. In the telecoms space we have started looking at a number of machine infrastructure applications which is a step out on some of the other infra investments we have done in Telecoms. </p>
  <p>“We have a really effective way of adding value to these smaller mid markets companies. We work hand-to-hand to build management teams, build management communications, and do add on acquisitions and corporate development which is really important when valuations are high. We are paying market valuations for good companies and being able to increase their size through growth in addition to organic growth is really important.” </p>

  <p class="text-info">US private equity firm RCP Advisors has passed its $250m target for its latest fund, and could keep going to raise up to $400m, AltAssets can reveal.</p>
  <p>The firm has registered close to $265m for RCP Fund X according to a pair of updated filings with the US Securities & Exchange Commission. AltAssets revealed in July that RCP had registered about $240m for the fund of funds vehicle, although SEC filings sometimes underestimate how much capital has been “soft-circled” from LPs.</p>
  <p>The firm only revealed it had pulled in more than $350m for its ninth fund in January last year, and three months later had already registered Fund X. Fund IX also had a $400m hard cap. The firm closed Fund VIII in 2013 with $268m of commitments from 202 LPs, including the Florida State Board of Administration and the Nebraska Investment Council. RCP invests in lower mid-market buyout funds of $100m to $1bn that target companies with enterprise value of $25m to $250m. </p>

  <p class="text-info">Lower mid market-focused private equity firm McCarthy Capital has registered close to $213m for its latest flagship fund, AltAssets can reveal.</p>
  <p>The firm has picked up $212.9m from 20 investors for Fund VI to date according to a filing with the US securities regulator. That filing indicates McCarthy hopes to wrap up the fundraise within the next 12 months, although no target is listed for the vehicle. Lazard Freres is acting as a placement agent for the vehicle, the filing adds. </p>
  <p>Omaha-based McCarthy exclusively targets businesses with revenues below $250m, typically investing between $10m and $50m in MBOs, recapitalisations and growth capital deals. The firm has been fairly secretive about its fundraising to date, but is believed to have targeted about $300m for its fifth fund. It had raised at least $158m for that vehicle by March 2012 according to an earlier filing with the SEC. Investments made using that fund include Signal 88 Security and United Real Estate Holdings.</p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter3-article5"></a><h2>Yossarian Capital Partners exploring unoccupied territory with maiden $150m fund</h2>
  <p class="text-info">Yossarian Capital Partners, a new private equity firm currently raising its first $150m fund, is breaking new ground with both its investment and its fundraising strategy. </p>
  <p>Hanh Nguyen, the firm’s managing partner who previously was a compliance specialist at US group ACA, told AltAssets about her idea to revitalise distressed communities via small-scale impact investing and achieve greater transparency by promoting the fund through general solicitation. Nguyen said, “The Great Yuma Fund [dedicated entirely to impact investing in Yuma, Arizona] is about the double bottom line of healthy returns and social impact, but we evaluate investment opportunities through a financial screen first because we believe that the social impact is already a positive externality of the deployment of capital in a single community.</p>
  <p>“If we seek good returns we can attract more interest from LPs over time to help more communities and further our social impact.</p>
  <p>My dream is to see this grow and become the new economic development framework in America. I would love to be able to enter more communities that are depressed or stagnating and make a difference in an underserved market.</p>
  <p>Zooming in rather than out</p>
  <p>“I noticed that most impact investment funds are trying to tackle the really big problems of our time like world hunger, affordable housing, universal healthcare, or climate change. Those initiatives are very noble, but the task at hand is large and seemingly never-ending. My idea is to bring a particular issue into a smaller perspective.</p>
  <p>“The concept behind the fund is to go into a distressed community, where the actual American middle class lives, and tackle the problems of that specific community with a fund that’s been specifically sized and a strategy that was individually formulated to address the needs of that one community. This is what is unique of Yossarian Capital Partners’ investment model – zooming in and addressing the issues of an individual community with the help of strong local relationships.</p>
  <p>“The KKRs and TPGs of the world are renowned for what they do, but even they cannot go into small communities and just have it their way because there would be pushback. There is a complexity to doing business in small town America and as an outsider, you may have the advantage of big bucks but not the same local business knowledge or relationships as locals. Recognising this I have created a model where the GP is a board of local business leaders who have been strategically selected to sit on the investment committee, to source investment opportunities and deploy the capital.”</p>
  <p>Sizing to fit community needs without saturating local market</p>
  <p>“I expect LPs in the fund will be primarily ultra-high net worth individuals and family offices, with endowments and foundations making up a portion of it. Institutional investors like pension funds generally have investment mandates with large minimum capital commitments so they are not likely to get involved in an impact investing fund of this size. And we sized the fund to fit the needs of the community.</p>
  <p>“To put things into perspective: The budget for the City of Yuma this year is around $338m and we are launching a $150m fund. This is less than half of what the city needs to operate annually. So what we are is a catalyst investment in the region. We strategically sized the fund so that it does not saturate the market. What we want to avoid is individual LPs holding more than 20 per cent interest in the fund to keep any one investor from becoming a “control person”.</p>
  <p>“We would love to have an anchor investor but their commitment would be in the range of $15m-$29m. We do not want to trigger the $30m (20 per cent interest) threshold for regulatory reasons. The minimum investment requirement in the fund is $2m. In the long term we are hoping to branch out fundraising to be able to partner with the state and state pension funds then may be interested in investing in communities within their home state. It is a natural alignment of interests.</p>
  <p>“For the time being though, this first Yuma-focused fund is the priority. However, there is interest from other communities and after the fund is raised and we have a few deals under our belt I can start thinking of expanding the firm and evaluating other communities.” </p>
  <p>Lot of traction” at the start of fundraising and lots of deals expected</p>
  <p>“After a few weeks in we have had a lot of traction in terms of publicity and the support of our messaging, but only time will tell how we will do in fundraising. We are currently working closely with a local organisation that was just established by the University of Arizona, called the Yuma Center for Excellence in Desert Agriculture, as part of developing our pipeline of deal opportunities.</p>
  <p>“In terms of expected number of deals for the life of the fund, I expect it will be a large number. I expect we will be able to do two to three deals a year at a minimum. Our investment period is four years – four years to divest and for follow on investments, then two one-year extensions if we deem necessary and with LPAC approval. We are catalyst investments so we will prefer deals that we can enter and exit quickly. </p>
  <p>“I want us to be packaging the right transactions to attract the types of companies that can flourish in the greater Yuma region and not for us to be acting as these companies in Yuma. I believe in the power of recycling capital too so the quicker we can enter and exit a deal, perhaps we can recycle that capital to do more deals.”</p>
  <p>General solicitation is about gaining more LPs</p>
  <p>“I am comfortable with using general solicitation due to my compliance background. I am aware of what the SEC regulators are looking for and understand what an SEC exam will be like. More importantly, I understand the thinking behind the regulation. I am not saying I am entirely unconcerned about the process but the SEC has created ‘safe harbours’ and I am planning to rely on them. We are using third parties like CPAs, lawyers, and other investment managers to verify our investors’ accredited investor status. Moreover, when you are talking about a fund with a $2m investment minimum, it is self-screening that an investor would meet the $1m net worth required of accredited investors.</p>
  <p>“Many advisers are nervous about receiving an SEC exam and the typical deficiency letter that comes after from the SEC (now referred to as a less daunting ‘examination summary letter’) which lists the examiner’s observations of the adviser’s compliance weaknesses that need improvement. I see it as an opportunity to learn how the regulators view my practices and where I might be able to make things better.</p>
  <p>“For me general solicitation is not about gaining more LPs. My decision to rely general solicitation was about the ability to share what I am doing with the general public. In this day and age and with an impact investment product like mine, it is important to tap into this social element in order to spread the message and increase public awareness to these communities.</p>
  <p>“So for me the choice had nothing to do with finding investors and had everything to do with being able to freely talk about what I do. Before this regulatory change to general solicitation, the whole point of being a private fund was that it was a private offering that you were not supposed to discuss with the public.</p>
  <p>“However, now, I can talk about the fund and its initiatives which is important to its success and our impact in the community because not many people will know about these small, depressed communities. The general public does not know where Yuma, Arizona is located, what its problems are, or the great unlocked potential of the community. General solicitation enables me to both raise awareness about the community and get investors excited about the idea of contributing to that community by investing in the fund.” </p>

  <p class="text-info">Emerging markets low-income community-focused venture capital firm Elevar Equity has hit a $74m final close for its third fund.</p>
  <p>Elevar said Fund III would commercial investments in early stage companies providing financial services, education, housing and healthcare to low-income communities, primarily in India and Latin America. Backers of the vehicle included the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, Oblate International Pastoral Investment Trust, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Omidyar Network and Prudential Financial as well as multiple family offices, private foundations and a university endowment.</p>
  <p>Elevar co-founder Maya Chorengel said, “We are pleased to have raised this fund, like our first two, purely from marquee private investors, a unique distinction among emerging market impact funds. “With six new investments already for EE III, adding to our first two funds’ 16 companies, we are touching over 18 million low-income households.”</p>
  <p>Rockefeller Brother vice president of finance and operations, Geraldine Watson, added, “The Rockefeller Brothers Fund believes its investment in EE III exemplifies the potential to make a meaningful societal impact while generating market rate returns. “Elevar serves a critical role in providing much needed capital to high-growth companies backed by experienced entrepreneurs who are using their talents to improve the lives of their customers and contribute to the responsible development of local economies.”</p>
  <p>Among EE III’s investments are Varthana, which seeks to combine financial services and education by providing loans and services to schools inIndia that serve millions of low income children, Financiera TFC, a diversified financial institution focused on low income housing loans in Peru, and Indifi – an online platform connecting small businesses with formal lending institutions in India. Omidyar Network has backed all three Elevar funds to date. Matt Bannick, managing partner at Omidyar Network, said, “We are pleased to be making our third investment in Elevar Equity. </p>
  <p>“They are truly pioneers in commercial impact investing. Elevar’s first fund has been among the best performing funds in the industry in terms of top quartile financial returns alongside demonstrable social impact – and the momentum of their second fund demonstrates that their method of investing delivers results.” Elevar closed its second vehicle with commitments of $70m in March 2010.</p>

  <p class="text-info">Mexican social enterprise-focused venture capital firm IGNIA has completed a $90m first close of its second fund.</p>
  <p>The capital has been raised especially for investments in high-growth companies in Mexico. Among the LPs backing the vehicle are Mexican pension funds which commit for the first time to a venture capital fund. IGNIA says this shows that institutional investors have confidence in its track record.</p>
  <p>Alvaro Rodriguez Arregui, co-founder and managing partner of IGNIA, said, “We are very grateful for the confidence that Mexican pension funds have placed in IGNIA Fund II and for the opportunity to continue investing in the tremendous opportunity that exists in the base of the pyramid market, which to date has been hugely unattended. We have identified companies in our pipeline that have an enormous potential. With IGNIA Fund II we will take advantage of the growing ecosystem of entrepreneurs in Mexico and the opportunities that we are finding.”</p>
  <p>Apart from the Mexico-focused vehicle IGNIA’s Fund II also includes an international vehicle, a Canadian limited partnership fund, which is currently fundraising from international and local investors. The international fund is expecting to hold a final close within the next six months. The Mexico vehicle was raised through the publicly traded certificates known as Development Capital Certificates (CKDs). </p>
  <p>These trust securities certificates were launched in 2009 and are designed primarily for the financing of long-term infrastructure projects in Mexico and the development of mid-size Mexican companies. Michael Chu, o-founder and managing director of IGNIA, commented, “When we founded IGNIA eight years ago we had the objective of connecting the capital markets with the base of the socioeconomic pyramid. The issuance of the CKDs in the public capital markets is a testament that this is possible.”</p>
  <p>With Fund II, IGNIA plans to continue its strategy of investing in businesses at the bottom of the socio-economic pyramid in Mexico. This is why companies from sectors such as healthcare, housing, education, financial, water, energy and communications are on the firm’s radar. The firm closed its debut fund on $102m in June 2010. IGNIA Fund I reached the close after seven rounds of fundraising, breaking initial targets of $50m to $75m, with the final round led by JP Morgan and a Corporacion Mexicana de Inversiones de Capitol fund of funds.</p>
