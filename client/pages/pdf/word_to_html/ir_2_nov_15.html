  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter1-article1"></a><h2>PE firms eyeing strong exits as M&A activity looks set to continue</h2>
  <p class="text-info">Private equity firms will be licking their lips at the possibility of strong exits as the recent wave of mergers and acquisitions activity by trade players looks to continue, new research suggests.</p>
  <p>About 59 per cent of global companies are now planning to acquire in the next 12 months according to the latest Global Capital Confidence Barometer report from professional services firm EY. The survey, which covers more than 1,600 executives in 53 countries, revealed the highest appetite to acquire in its six-year history. It said an M&A market buoyed by record values in 2015 was set for further growth in the next year.</p>
  <p>The report said that with global deal value up 35 per cent on 2014 and more $10bn-plus megadeals already announced in 2015 than in any previous year, the prospect of further growth in the M&A market looks certain. Four out of five executives (83 per cent) expect activity to increase. EY said that those positive sentiments are fuelled by their own burgeoning pipelines – which continue to expand, with 55 per cent of companies now having three or more deals under consideration.</p>
  <p>Pip McCrostie, EY global vice chair for transaction advisory services, said, “With modest increases in global GDP, organic growth alone is not enough for companies to expand and reshape at the pace they need. Technology and changing consumer preferences are disrupting business models and blurring sector boundaries. In that context, the search for growth is lifting deal-making to record highs – and executives are focusing on M&A to secure innovation, competitive advantage and market share for the foreseeable future.”</p>
  <p>EY said the current deal environment was fostering M&A intentions. Executives are more confident than at any time in the past six years about the quality and number of deal opportunities, and the likelihood of closing acquisitions. Despite the high appetite to acquire, any fears about an overheating market can be tempered by strong rigor around deals. Executives are judicious about how they use M&A according to the report, with almost three quarters having walked away from deals in the past 12 months because they were not fully aligned with their strategy.</p>
  <p>McCrostie said, “Executives are taking a long-term view and evaluating deals more carefully than ever before. They are stepping back when necessary. “This is not ‘a deals for deals sake mentality.” The sectors with the highest level of M&A intent are oil and gas (69 per cent), consumer products (67 per cent), mining and metals (67 per cent), diversified industrial products (66 per cent), and power and utilities (65 per cent). </p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter1-article2"></a><h2>European bolt-on activity peaks as overall PE investment slides</h2>
  <p class="text-info">European private equity bolt-on activity has hit a record level for the year as high asset prices encourage consolidation of existing businesess, new research suggests.</p>
  <p>PE investment activity is still on the slide from 2014’s high watermark despite capital invested remaining high, the latest report from Pitchbook shows. The Q4 2015 European PE Breakdown research said the third quarter saw 985 private deals close, a decline of close to 36 per cent from a high of 1,534 in 1Q 2014. Total invested capital is still high, however, with venture capital especially seeing “massive sums” invested this year.</p>
  <p>Pitchbook said that at close to €9.5bn invested through the end of 3Q, 2015 has already overtopped 2014’s total VC invested. It added that exits in 3Q were down, but said that even if exit activity is sliding as of late, overall, the year and 2014 combined had seen massive value exited by PE and VC firms. The report said, “It’s likely 2014 will remain a high-water mark for private investment for some time.</p>
  <p>“In terms of capital invested by both buyout and VC firms, persistently high asset prices have kept numbers fairly elevated, but the more telling trend is the slide in overall private investment count. The swell of activity appears to have peaked in the first quarter of 2014 at 1,534 deals, and since has subsided by close to 36% to hit 985 in the most recent quarter. Heightened valuations have taken a toll on activity, even if they have yet to truly affect overall value.”</p>
  <p>“The question is the extent to which activity will fall, as well as what will happen when overall value inevitably declines. Countervailing forces are at work here, especially for PE buyout firms. Although regulations are still a deterrent to the riskier forms of lending, interest rates could plunge even deeper. But at the same time, European lending markets are not as varied or broad as those in the US, so the availability of financing from alternate lenders, when it comes to buyouts, is considerably less.” </p>
  <p>The report added that PE buyout shops have pockets of distressed mid-market companies or businesses ripe for operational enhancement in an era of sustained sluggish growth, as well as owners looking to retire, have kept the pipeline of prospects relatively full over the past few years. It said that those drivers should continue to keep it full.</p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter1-article3"></a><h2>South Africa showing resilience, continues regional PE dominance</h2>
  <p class="text-info">South Africa is showing resilience amid a challenging economic environment as it retains its dominance of the Southern African region.</p>
  <p>The country saw 341 private equity deals completed between 2007 and 2014 with a combined value of $6.7bn according to the latest report from the African Private Equity and Venture Capital Association. That accounted for 76 per cent of deal volume and 92 per cent of deal value in Southern Africa from 2007-2014, it added. The research also revealed differing sector trends in South Africa compared to the rest of Southern Africa.PE activity in South Africa is heavily focused in sectors associated with the country’s strong manufacturing base, and the growth of its middle class consumer base. </p>
  <p>The industrials, consumer discretionary, real estate and materials sectors accounted for 63 per cent of the volume of transactions in the country from 2007 – 2014. AVCA’s report showcased a strong exit environment in Southern Africa overall, with 127 PE exits recorded between 2007 and 2014. Exits via sales to trade buyers – many to South African firms looking to expand their footprint within South Africa and across the region – accounted for a large proportion of exits in the region. </p>
  <p>As with the rest of Africa, there is increasing diversification of exit routes, it added. AVCA chief executive Michelle Kathryn Essomé said, “The outlook for private equity in Southern Africa remains promising. “The strong exit environment will continue to encourage investment in the asset class. GPs that have successfully navigated the global financial crisis and are able to deliver returns are likely to prove attractive to LPs and increase fund flow into the region.” </p>
  <p>AVCA research analyst Ponmile Osibo added, “PE in Southern Africa excluding South Africa  is still relatively nascent and is therefore likely to see increased deal activity as indigenous country and regional funds emerge. “With a number of countries actively enacting reforms and initiatives to diversify their economies away from commodities, we expect PE to play a crucial role in the region’s broader economic development.” </p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter1-article4"></a><h2>Sensitisation at heart of Nigerian pension funds embrace of more PE investments</h2>
  <p class="text-info">Sensitisation of Nigerian pension funds to the benefits of private equity investments has been essential for the gradual adoption of PE in the country.</p>
  <p>And this trend needs to continue if one wants to ensure the expansion of capital allocation in that asset class, Chinelo Anohu-Amazu, director-general of the Pension Commission (PenCom) of Nigeria, said in a keynote interview at the Financial Times and EMPEA conference on Private Equity in Africa 2015. “There has been a change [over the last ten years]. We have seen that many PE funds are taking time to sensitize pension fund managers. Rather than sit back and wonder why the pension funds are not investing they are organising seminars educating of the obvious advantages of investing in private equity.</p>
  <p>“Also, as a regulator we have introduced the multi-tier investment structure which allays some of the fears. Now you have some of the younger contributors, who have a larger appetite for private equity.” It is the PenCom’s priority to do more about educating everybody about private equity. “We are looking to bring the informal sector in the pension scheme and that will marginally increase the size of the pension fund assets. The Commission is taking the issue of sensitisation very seriously because there will be more assets contributed with very few investment outlets for the pension funds.”</p>
  <p>So far, Nigerian pension funds have invested too little in PE and the slow uptake has been due to two main issues – legislation and lack of understanding. Regulation prevented pension funds to invest in PE for years and is still limiting the percentage of asset allocation. “The legislation now allows 5 per cent investment in PE but out of these we have just 0.3 per cent actually invested. The new regulations on the multi-tier model allow 5 per cent, so unless there is more sensitization and more structure involved, awareness of how these PE firms operate we will not see uptake fully maximised.”</p>
  <p>Lack of knowledge about the asset class has been and remains a barrier to a quicker expansion of PE investments. “[The pension landscape] has not been a very comfortable space in Africa and especially in Nigeria where before the reform in 2004 there were issues with mismanagement and improper governance.</p>
  <p>“Coming from that space we started building trusts where people began saving for their retirement benefits. This building process continued from 2004 to 2010 when the first funds were opened for PE investments. The main issue was that people did not understand what PE is all about. It was a vague asset class even for the managers of the pension funds. </p>
  <p>“ And if they happened to understand it, the businesses were owned by board members and trustees who did not. Furthermore, the long-term nature of the returns on investment was not something they were interested in because bonds and other assets classes were a quicker investment. Nigerian pension fund managers are betting on the safest investments. In this country this is the priority. In fact, 67 per cent of Nigerian pension fund assets are currently invested in government bonds.</p>
  <p>“That is something on that we as a regulator are working to change because ideally this should be going in sectors like infrastructure and real estate because that is where the needs are. We are also talking to the Nigerian government because most of them would want some level of government guarantee. These are the things we are looking to see happen in 2016 – clear investments directed to the critical areas and provide more jobs, and bring more people into the pension scheme and more contributors, and increase the size of the funds.” </p>
  <p>The growing population in Nigeria means more people will need retirement benefits and pension funds are bound to grow in size. How big cannot be assessed from a current point of view because PenCom is looking to include the informal sector into the pension scheme in the future and nobody can say how big this sector is. According to the African Development Bank, with a growth rate of 30 per cent over the last four years, total pension funds are projected to reach $100bn by 2020. But bigger size would not be a problem for Nigeria even though levels of PE investments remain low. Anohu-Amazu said, “You have to see this another way. If there is more capital, there will be more projects.</p>
  <p>“Africa’s infrastructure needs investments so there is no such thing as too much capital.” There should not be concerns over the scale of the projects as well. If it is not the right scale attractive for investments “… you scale up or scale down,” Anohu-Amazu said. “Africa does not have a “one-size-fits-all” proposition. What we have seen with the pension funds and even with the whole pension reform story in Nigeria is that not accepting the one-size-fits-all mentality works. We are aware of the local risks in Nigeria and that is why foreign investors should take a look at local funds who understand the risks.” </p>
  <p>Anohu-Amazu had a few tips how foreign private equity investors could ensure good returns in Nigeria’s market. First and foremost is getting local knowledge. “First advice for foreign investors is they should find a local partner. There is high corporate governance of where the pension funds go so if I were a foreign investor coming from a different country I will watch where the pension funds go and co-invest there because that way you create a bigger impact. You look what those with skin in the game do because they are aware of the local situation.</p>
  <p>“Someone away from the country would probably blow out of proportion or underestimate the risks. Once you find that correlation then it will be easier for you to bring something to the table that will work rather than forcing a situation based on a pre-perceived illusion of what it should be.” Investors also should look at the level of regulation, Anohu-Amazu advised.</p>
  <p>“What the PenCom is looking to address with the introduction of the multi-fund structure is foreign investors’ concerns about regulation limiting the amount of liquidity you can hold in a fund. The nature of pension funds means one needs a certain percentage of liquid assets to meet the liabilities on a daily basis. When you have multi-tier sector than you can afford to send some to infrastructure and then still have some in liquidity. Next year we expect that the multi-fund structure will be placed and that will go along to ameliorate that risk.”</p>
  <p>Foreign investors should not be discouraged or put off of investing in Nigeria just because the country’s pension funds themselves are not keen on allocating more to private equity. This should be seen as an opportunity, Anohu-Amazu stressed. There is room for more investments, growth and returns. If I were a private equity fund and I see the market is already saturated why would I go there?” She also said it is the job of private equity funds to educate local pension funds about the benefits of investing in PE. “We as a regulator are just levelling the field for private equity but it is the private equity funds job to make investments attractive for local LPs.”</p>
  <p>One of the most important things for PenCom and the government in the future is bringing the people working in the grey economy into pension schemes. “As impossible as it seems the government is taking the task very seriously. It has to be done. Status is the important thing here. There has to be some formalisation of the informal sector because people there are in the direst need of retirement benefits. We have started the process with The Union of Tailors and so far there have been 601 claimants and we are going bit by bit.”</p>
  <p>The much needed pension changes in Nigeria have taken years but progress has been made Anohu-Amazu said. Until the major reform in 2004 there were just a few attempts to change the system. The reform introduced the contributory pension schemes and most importantly things were privately managed. Every individual had their retirement savings account and these assets were held separately from those who manage the funds.</p>
  <p>“We introduced a new asset class – the pension fund custodians, which had the National Pension Commission as their regulator and their investments required daily reporting. That changed the landscape of the pension industry and introduced more transparency, higher corporate governance and strictly-regulated investment space. So, that in itself helped to build trust.  There was a big pushback against the process and the unfortunate thing was that most of it came from those standing to benefit from the reforms.</p>
  <p>“People did not want their money touched for any reason. They did not want to contribute at all, they all wanted it to be government defined. It took a lot of time for us to explain to them that the only way forward is ownership and to own you have to contribute and that was actually one of the bigger problems we had. But there has been improvement over the last 10 years as people are seeing more clearly the model works.” As at the end of 2014, Nigerian pension funds had NGN11.1bn ($36.3bn), or 0.24 per cent of all assets, allocated into private equity, according to PenCom data. </p>

  <a class="anchor-hack" id="chapter1-article5"></a><h2>Currency at forefront of risks in developing countries dealmaking, LPs say</h2>
  <p class="text-info">Currency risk plays a major role in deciding whether to support a private equity fund in an emerging market according to limited partners at the Private Equity in emerging markets conference.</p>
  <p>Speaking on the Limited Partner Panel, EBRD director of equity funds, Anne Fossemalle, said, “It is a very important aspect for us to look in the markets where we work.” Anna told the members of the Financial Times and EMPEA-run event that “Russia and Turkey are defiantly top of the list when we look at this, look at what happened with Russia last year.”</p>
  <p>Earlier this year the Chinese stock market plunged after concerns over the country’s slowing growth triggering a global sell-off. China’s main stock exchange, fell 7.6 per cent losing 8.5 per cent, and as a result it was the worst fall since 2007, causing sharp drops in developed and demonstrating the volatility and risks associated by with currencies.</p>
  <p>While in December last year, the price of oil fell sharply, draining the Russia’s economy of foreign money and driving the ruble to an 11 per cent drop, forcing Russia’s central bank to raise interest rates by 650 basis points. Fossemalle added, “ I think the one way to look at it is this a long term game, we have to see what happens to the currencies in the long run and what happens to this portfolio companies. What we have seen in of our lot of funds is managers leading investments in companies that are exporting, so at least the returns and revenues are going to be in the same currency and the same as the fund domination.”</p>
  <p>Padmesh Skuka, head of pensions investment at TFL Pensions fund, agreed that the currency risk is a major issue when investing in developing countries. On the point about currencies, the view I take is that the currency risk premium is always there and you’re always aware of it. I think what has happened recently is pretty much off the chart, so I think that will probably reinforce some of strategies, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing. If you are happy to take a long term view, which is what these markets are all about, there is always that element.” Fossemalle said that when it comes to migrating the aforementioned risk, EBRD doesn’t actively hedge its equity portfolio because everywhere they work, to an certain extent, has that issue.</p>
  <p>“However we work a lot in central Europe in countries like Poland and Romina etc, their currencies is pretty indexed in to the Euro so there is far less volatility in these countries. Overall that balances out the portfolio. These countries still have emerging market characteristics, but they have a currency which is much more stable than the Turkish litre or the Russian Ruble.”</p>
  <p>QADIC CEO Serge Lepine, added that it is defiantly a subject The Qatar Abu Dhabi Investment Company considers but admits there is only so much you can protect yourself against. One way for us has been to favour regional strategies, as opposed to country’s or cities. Beyond that it is more down to the manager to adopt a more micro strategy and target companies which are naturally hedged.”</p>

  <p class="text-info">Exits are not the issue when it comes investing in power assets in developing countries – the issue lies in finding capital to make them operational, according to panellists at this week’s Private Equity in Emerging Markets conference in London. </p>
  <p>Exits are not an issue for power assets in developing couExits are not the issue when it comes investing in power assets in developing countries – the issue lies in finding capital to make them operational, according to panelists at this week’s Private Equity in Emerging Markets conference inSpeaking on the infrastructure and energy investments panel, Crescent Capital founder and managing partner Aygen Yayikoglu, said, “I would say that I 100 per cent believe that in our case exits are the least of our concerns.”</p>
  <p>With a burgeoning demand for electricity in developing countries driving the need for substantial investment in energy infrastructure, combined with compelling returns, the panelists agree exiting is not a problem. Brooks Preston, head of investment funds department at OPIC, said, “I agree with what was said about exits, these are scarce resources and there is quite often a few buyers.  But you also have to look 20 years from now and beyond that. Africa a year or two had the power generation capacity of Sweden, the whole continent.”</p>
  <p>Attendees at the Financial Times and EMPEA-run event heard Cyrille Arnould, head of the GEEREF fund of funds at the European Investment Bank say, “Worst case scenario is you can’t sell and instead you are sitting on a portfolio of case generating assets. Compared to other private equity investment strategies this is pretty unique. This isn’t about to be over because there is a deficit of power production in developing countries.”</p>
  <p>Moderator Jeff Schalinski asked if the exit environment might change as the global monetary environment changes, interest rates increase, the Federal Reserve changes its base line etc. He asked if they thought that would lead to a search for yield and less of search of these operational assets. Mackin responded by saying, “I think not, that is because the case that we underwrite to every time we head into a project we always go to the end of the line and look at how we are going to exit. </p>
  <p>“It always a strategic, we think the yield buyers are frothy and they are more concentrated on where the yield is going. Where we get a lot of interest is from people seeking differentiated plays. You can shed commodities risk as it is not dependent on oil and gas. We have had really good traction from investors looking for a differentiated play, where they can sell to an infrastructure market and make strong private equity returns.”</p>
  <p>All of the panellists agreed that generally making an exit in the power sector in emerging markets wasn’t an issue, instead the problem lies in accessing cash to build operational assets. Scott Mackin, Denhan Capital managing partner and co-president, said, “ There is plenty of money looking for operating assets, there is even plenty of money that will now come and take construction risk because they can’t get access to it while waiting for development.</p>
  <p>“Where there isn’t plenty of the money, and the gap we are really trying to fill, is knowledgeable capital that take a project through bankability, through construction and up to operations. That’s the problem, there isn’t enough capital or enough knowledgeable people doing that. You have a mismatch of supply for these projects for a tremendous demand for them.” Yayikoglu said that because of the all of the reasons of risk perception, most of the long term investors don’t have access to the operational assets.</p>
  <p>“It started, with a few investing directly and others via funds, but this is only the start of it. There is going to be a huge amount of money coming from pension funds, insurance firms, sovereign wealth funds and from global investors, global pension fund and global retail investors. They’re going to come into these assets because the alternatives are very rare, as we heard this morning they are very poor in terms of returns, all other are inferior in terms of returns. This is a rare asset class and we are going to see a lot of investment.”</p>
  <p>Mackin added, “With a growing demand for electricity in developing economies driving a need for substantial investment in energy infrastructure, investors now have the opportunity to earn storing returns, create economical growth and also development through increased access to reliable and affordable power.” London.</p>

  <p>CPPIB and BC Partners will each pay about $400m for 12 per cent of US cable operator Cablevision, with the balance funded by unnamed co-investors. Shane Feeney, head of direct private equity at CPPIB, said, “This is an attractive opportunity to invest in a sector that we know well. We are pleased to further expand our relationship with Altice, a best-in-class cable operator, and BC Partners, a longstanding fund partner.” The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2016, subject to regulatory and other customary approvals.</p>
  <p>Earlier this year Altice agreed to buy a majority stake in CPPIB and BC Partners-backed Suddenlink in a $9.1bn deal. The pair bought Suddenlink in 2012 for an enterprise value of $6.5bn.

  <p class="text-info">Italian private equity firm IDEA Capital is expecting to hold the final close of its Taste of Italy fund in the middle of next year at its €200m target.</p>
  <p>Italian private equity firm IDEA Capital is expecting to hold the final close of its Taste of Italy fund in the middle of next year at its €200m target. Francesco Sironi, head of business development at IDEA Capital, told AltAssets capital in the fund by the end of 2015 is expected to reach €160m to €180m. The fund, focused on agri-food sector investments, raised €140m at its second close in July this year.</p>
  <p>IDEA has already tapped the Taste of Italy fund this year for the acquisition of a 70 per cent stake in Italian tortilla-making restaurant chain La Piadineria group. Another deal for the family buyout of an Italian wine business is expected to be signed by the end of the year and completed in early 2016, Sironi said. The Taste of Italy fund is the third direct investment private equity fund launched by Idea Capital. The company is aiming to raise sector-specific funds focused on small, niche Italian-based businesses.</p>
  <p>Taste of Italy is looking at predominantly domestic-market investments in businesses with €20m to €200m revenues and over €4m EBITDA. The fund is ready to commit between €10m and €30m for each deal for up to 12 companies. The expansion segment, concerning minority acquisitions in existing businesses, accounted for 72 per cent of fundraising in Italy’s PE market last year, according to figures of the Italian Private Equity and Venture Capital Association (AIFI).</p>
  <p>The amount invested by expansion-type PE funds surged 29 per cent on the year to €1.2bn from €914m in 2013, although the number of transactions, fell to 101 from 138 deals between 2014 and 2013. Looking ahead, Sironi said Idea Capital is planning the launch of a new fund, focused specifically on investments in the luxury products sector. Target companies will be in SMEs with average revenues €20m to €200m.</p>
  <p>As with previous industry-specific funds, the new vehicle will cover a wide range of luxury industry-related segments, such as fashion, luxury products and design. This will allow more scope for investment and greater diversification, Sironi said. He stressed that despite having turning to a new industry, Idea Capital would not abandon the sectors it has already committed to, which are sustainable energy (with the €100m in its energy efficiency and sustainable development fund launched in 2011) and food & beverage (Taste of Italy).</p>
  <p>He said, “When the energy fund reaches maturity in terms of investments, divestments and returns we will raise a successor fund to it, in the energy sector. “The same goes for Taste of Italy: once it reaches maturity we will raise a successor fund in the food and beverage sector.”</p>
  <p>Energy, food and luxury goods were all in the top 10 sectors by number of PE investment transactions completed in 2014, according to AIFI data. Energy ranked fourth with 24 completed deals, food ranked sixth with 17 and luxury goods tied with retail for the tenth place with 12 completed transactions. While sticking to its guns in the chosen sectors, what Idea Capital will be looking to change the foreign involvement in its funds. The firm is keen on having more overseas LPs aboard in the future as it is aiming to forge sustainable long-term relationships.</p>
  <p>Italian PE investors, according to Sironi, tend to be less developed in their private equity strategy and therefore might lack consistency from time to time. So a long-lasting fund-raising strategy requires a look beyond Italy’s borders, he says. Almost all foreign LPs Idea Capital is currently working with are non-Italian blue-chip companies backing the closed-end investment fund Investitori Associati IV. The vehicle, launched in 2004, was inherited from fund manager Investitori Associati Società di Gestione del Risparmio (SGR). Idea took over management of that fund in April 2015.</p>
  <p>The firm is considering 20-30 per cent foreign involvement in the Taste of Italy fund as well. Through co-investments, as they provide a basis for collaboration between managers with in-depth knowledge of the industry and experts familiar with regional PE market specifics, according to Sironi. Idea Capital is targeting foreign investors from Europe as they are more ready to recognise that Italy is on the way of recovery and willing to get involved with local businesses, Sironi says. US investors, on the other hand, are still wary of returning to the market in Italy maybe because still worried of macro-economic risks.</p>
  <p>Investors from countries in the Mediterranean region (i.e. France and Spain), which are more likely to have a deeper understanding of the Italian way of thinking are preferred partners due to the close links to Italian culture. LPs from Germany and the UK are also regarded as an attractive option for future partnership to his LinkedIn profile. </p>

  <p class="text-info">Morningside, the private investment group launched by Hong Kong’s Chan family in 1986, has hit a $660m final close for its fourth China-focused fund.</p>
  <p>The firm said it had received re-ups from all the existing LPs backing its third vehicle, including endowments, pension funds, sovereign wealth funds and family offices in Europe and the US. AltAssets revealed that Morningside had pulled in at least $280m for its third fund in February 2014, but no further details of that fundraise have been released by the firm.</p>
  <p>Morningside invests in private equity and venture capital opportunities in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific, with China become an increasingly significant part of its activities since 1992. It targets areas including cleantech, life sciences, machinery manufacturing and media, as well as education and telecommunications.</p>
  <p>The firm completed a $150m fundraise for its first TMT fund in 2008, and followed that up with a $250m-targeting second vehicle in 2011. It is also unclear whether the firm hit that target, although a separate filing shows it had gathered at least $131m in the summer of 2011.</p>
