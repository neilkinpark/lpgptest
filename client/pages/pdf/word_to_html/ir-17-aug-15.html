  <a id="chapter1-article1" class="anchor-hack"></a><h2>PE investment activity halves as summer lull hits</h2>
  <p class="text-info">The value of global private equity deals fell 46 per cent in July to $32.6bn, a huge drop compared to the $60.5bn of deals recorded the previous month, new research suggests.</p>
  <p>Although PE deals commonly fall away as the long summer holidays within the industry take hold, the July figure is down nine per cent compared to the same time last year, suggesting a more general slowdown in activity. Volume also weakened between June and July, from 662 transactions to 600, but was up by more than a fifth on the same time a year ago according to the research by Zephyr published by BvD. Individual transaction values were modest in July, with five deals topping $1bn and none exceeding $5bn.</p>
  <p>The largest PE deal by value in July saw a consortium of TDR Capital, investment vehicles of sovereign wealth funds Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and Singapore’s GIC, and Dutch and Danish pension funds acquire LeasePlan, a Dutch vehicle financing company owned by Volkswagen and German bank Metzler, for just over $4bn. The Blackstone Group and Corsair Capital teamed up to purchase a majority stake in Arnhold and S. Bleichroeder Holdings, the holding company of US asset manager First Eagle Investment Management for $4bn in the number two deal by value.</p>
  <p>Seven of the top 20 deals targeted US companies, while UK and Netherlands-based businesses were each targeted in three transactions. Other countries targeted in the top 20 included China, Spain, Germany, Denmark, India and France. A total of $12.9bn was invested in US companies in July, less than half the $26.7bn recorded the previous month. Year-on-year there was marginal growth compared to the $10.9bn-worth of deals signed off in July 2014.</p>
  <p>By contrast, there was a more than 10-fold increase in the value of PE investment targeting the Netherlands, from $532m in June to $5.5bn, the country’s highest result for over a year. The value of deals targeting UK companies weakened by a quarter month-on-month to $3.1bn and was lower than the same time in 2014. The US maintained its number one position in the volume rankings, with 201 deals targeting companies based in the country, but this was a fifth lower than 253 transactions in June. France was ranked second with 70 deals, the country’s highest result of the 12 months under review, and the UK third with 60, its best result since December.</p>
  <p>tech companies has begun to accelerate. “I think 2015 will finish strong and carry over in 2016.” Mr. Miller added “There are some amazing companies that have filed confidentially.”</p>

  <a id="chapter1-article2" class="anchor-hack"></a><h2>‘Pig in python’ fundraise of 2007 still weighing on 2014 PE data: Cambridge Associates</h2>
  <p class="text-info">When Cambridge Associates’ head of US private equity research refers to 2007 as a “vintage year”, she isn’t talking about wine.</p>
  <p>Rather, Andrea Auerbach is referring to the fact that 2007 was the biggest year ever for private equity fundraising in the States since Cambridge began tracking PE data there in 1986, almost 30 years ago. And because it preceded the global financial crisis, 2007 has also been something of a numerical “pig in a python” to private equity statisticians, like Auerbach and her Cambridge Associates colleagues, ever since. This fact comes up when AltAssets recently asked Auerbach, who is also a managing director of Cambridge Associates, to help make sense of the Boston-based research organisation’s just-released 2014 year-end private equity statistics.</p>
  <p>The data, which the organisation publishes quarterly, incorporates the performance figures of more 11,000 US private equity companies. The annual data is comprised of more than 15,000 transactions that took place during the year. The reason the data isn’t released earlier is due to the lag typically incurred between investee companies reporting year-end data, and general partners compiling that information into their own year-end fund performance data and reporting that to their investors, Cambridge Associates said.</p>
  <p>In terms of headline trends, the Cambridge Associates LLC US Private Equity Index returned 11.2 per cent for the year, which wasn’t as good as the NASDAQ Composite (13.4 per cent) or S&P 500 (13.7 per cent), and well off the 21.5 per cent returned by Cambridge’s 2014 Venture Capital Index. For both private equity and venture capital funds in the US in 2014, meanwhile, health care, IT and software were the top-performing sectors, while energy-related investments fell off a cliff during the final three months of the year (down 14.1 per cent), for an annualised decline of 2.4 per cent, the Cambridge Associates data shows.</p>
  <p>While acknowledging that these numbers are irresistible to investors, who can’t help wanting to “peek” at the performance of their investments, Auerbach points out something that these investors will also be aware of — that private equity investments are made on such a long time horizon that even annual comparisons with, for example, a stock exchange index, are less than ideal. Though it’s not a complete waste of time. “Private companies are typically priced or valued according to their public market comparables,” she points out.</p>
  <p>“But as a rule, taking a longer term view of these particular strategies is just more practical. You can’t begin to know what you’ve got, for example, in the first quarter after you’ve made an investment in a venture capital fund.” That said, for those who know how to read the Cambridge Associates numbers, there are some illuminating trends, Auerbach says. And one of these is that “pig in the python” year of 2007.</p>
  <p>“To many people, that year feels like a distant memory now, yet if you look at our data, you’ll see it continues to materially influence the performance of the private equity index,” she says. “And because it was so large, it is probably going to continue to, until it is largely realised.” Still, eight years in, “there is some light at the end of the tunnel, looking at the calendar year return for 2014 of 12.5 per cent.”</p>
  <p>Another “take-away” of the data, according to Auerbach, is that the energy sector is having an “extended bad day” as a result of the decline in the price of oil that occurred in the final months of 2014, while the IT and software sectors, for now at least, are “eating the private equity index” in a way that recalls American software entrepreneur Marc Andreessen’s famous 2011 quip that software was, even then, eating the world.</p>
  <p>And last but not least, the healthcare sector is “a perennially-producing investment strategy in both the private equity and venture” indices, notwithstanding a certain reluctance on the part of many Americans to invest in the sector recently as a result of uncertainties about the sector’s future due to Obamacare. Over a 10-, 15-, 20- and 25-year time horizon, the Cambridge Associates private equity index  outperformed the NASDAQ Composite, S&P 500 and the Russell 2000 indices, though Cambridge Associates officials note that this isn’t that surprising because private equity indexes are capital weighted, and thus the largest, so-called vintage years tend to drive the performance.</p>
  <p>For the fourth year running last year, US private equity firms returned more money to their backers than they invested. These companies handed back some $153.5bn – the largest amount since 1986, and nearly twice the $84.9bn investors entrusted them with during the year. (This latter figure was $25.7 more than investors committed in 2013, and the most since 2008.) Last year was also the fourth in a row – but only the eighth since the inception of the Cambridge Associates private equity index – in which distributions outpaced contributions.</p>

  <p class="text-info">CVC Capital Partners has come out on top as the most in demand European large leveraged buyout manager on the secondaries market, according to Setter Capital.</p>
  <p>In the 2015 second quarter 20 Most Sought-After European Large LBO Managers on the Secondary Market report, Apax Partners and EQT Partners came second and third respectively. Terra Firma Capital Partners was one of the new managers on the list, while 3i Buyouts dropped out of the top 20. The top 10 most sought-after European large buyout funds are: CVC, Apax, EQT, BC Partners, Cinven, Charterhouse Capital Partners, Nordic Capital, Altor, PAI Europe and Permira.</p>
  <p>The average price paid for stakes in the top 20 funds was 97.74 per cent of net asset value, with an average internal rate of return of 16.64 per cent. The report is based on the Setter Liquidity Rating which rates fund families as excellent, very good, good and unrated depending on how sought-after and saleable they are on the secondary market. Back in June, Blackstone, Apollo and Bain Capital topped Setter Capital’s most sought-after US large LBO managers rankings.</p>

  <a id="chapter1-article4" class="anchor-hack"></a><h2>African fundraising still tricky but deal flow strong as ever, PE exec says</h2>
  <p class="text-info">When it comes to fundraising in Africa the main challenge is still informing investors about the difference between the perceived risk and the real risk according to Mediterrania Capital Partners founder, CEO and managing partner Albert Alsina.</p>
  <p>Despite the Barcelona-based firm closing its second North Africa-focused fund on €120m ($131.9m) last month, after just 12 months on the road and double the size of its first fund, Alsina revealed that fundraising in the region can still be tricky. He told AltAssets, “The fundraising environment was hard and that’s the area where we usually see the strongest competition. Educating investors to arbitrage the difference between the perceived risk vs the real risk in the region can be quite challenging sometimes.</p>
  <p>“We believe that we are in a very interesting moment for Africa. Investors are seeing more teams and big PE firms entering into Africa and this helps educate the industry in general and investors looking for growth opportunities.” According to new research, a tricky political and economic environment in North Africa has not affected the stability of private equity dealmaking in the region.</p>
  <p>Buyout firms’ continued appetite for investments in the area saw the region retain its 15 per cent share of private equity deal volume across all of Africa between 2007 and 2014, the Africa Private Equity and Venture Capital Association said in its Spotlight on North Africa Private Equity report last month. Alsina agreed, adding the political and economic environment in the region had a positive effect for the PE sector, “As firms are opening their capital more easily and there are less funds investing in the region.</p>
  <p>“This situation is creating very interesting entry points to portfolio companies combined with great assets opening their capital. The quality of our deal flow is as good as ever. The current environment is generating great opportunities to invest. We love this market right now.” The fund is planning to close between eight and 12 investments and so far according to Alsin it has already completed two, with another two set to close. It is also in the process of closing three additional investments in Tunisia and Algeria according to Alsina.</p>
  <p>MC II seeks growth opportunities in the Maghreb region (Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia), with potential expansion into Africa Sub-Saharan countries. In June the region was hit by a an Islamic terror attack at the tourist resort at Port El Kantaoui, about 10 kilometres north of the city of Sousse, Tunisia. Thirty-eight people were killed when an armed gunman attacked a hotel.</p>
  <p>However Alsina said, “Those type of events mainly affect the tourism sector and the currency reserves, therefore only impacting the economy partially. We are trying to mitigate the impact of those actions on our business by investing in core sectors that have a strong international presence or willingness to grow outside Tunisia. We believe on the fundamentals of the Maghreb region that offers very attractive entry points with 70 per cent of the population below 45 years-old and a raise of the needs of the middle class. The current moment is what it’s called in the financial sector “short-term turbulence with long-term growth.” </p>

  <h1>LP News</h1>
  <a id="chapter2-article1" class="anchor-hack"></a><h2>LP Profile: Brooks Preston, OPIC</h2>
  <p class="text-info">Experience in developing markets is attractive, but that doesn’t stop OPIC backing first-time funds as it pursues its tripartite goals of generating returns, fostering development and supporting US foreign policy.</p>
  <p>It is not unusual for a development finance institution (DFI) to have multiple goals, but Brooks Preston, vice-president for investment funds at the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), says the US government-backed organisation has three mandates when deciding the funds and countries in which to invest. OPIC ranks a fund’s ability to help push development in a region, including securing US interests in emerging markets, right alongside its potential for decent returns.</p>
  <p>“We’re unique in that we have a triple mandate, unlike any other investor,” he says. “To start with, we have a strong interest in returns. That’s the bread and butter of private equity, and we choose managers that will deliver institutional returns. The other two pieces are about development and mobilising private US capital into emerging markets in support of US foreign policy objectives.”</p>
  <p>OPIC operates by providing a specially structured debt to private equity firms that they can use as capital and which serves to attract other private investors. The private equity manager subsequently deploys the LP’s capital as if it were equity. Preston says GPs are attracted not just by the money but by the extra support OPIC can bring – for example, having access to the US embassy network and State Department to help address issues that may come up.</p>
  <p>“If we do our job well, we crowd in private equity that will participate in both our financial successes and our development successes,” he says. “In doing that we must be demand-driven. We’re not going to create funds where funds don’t exist. We search for high-quality teams that can deliver our triple mandate.” OPIC defines development as creating jobs through sectors such as infrastructure, as well as driving economic opportunity in low income emerging markets.</p>
  <p>“It’s also demonstrating to investors that you can do well by doing well,” says Preston. “If we can prove that you can do well and do good, then capital will flow to these markets and capital no longer becomes the limiting factor for great development projects.” The LP is courted by private equity firms operating in developing regions, who were invited to submit via OPIC’s Global Engagement Call for Proposals, which closed in June. Any fund managers who invest in companies operating in OPIC-eligible emerging market countries via direct equity, debt, and equity related instruments, are invited to pitch for funding. Part of OPIC’s mandate is to attract other private equity investors by sometimes backing smaller or unknown funds.</p>
  <p>“We are not investing on our own. We’re trying to choose managers who other private sector investors will have an interest in backing,” says Preston. “By nature they have to be strong and competitive, with relevant experience in the market and solid processes in place.” But that does not mean the DFI shies away from backing first-time managers. “They don’t have to be on fund number five. We’re at the cutting edge, so we do try to find a number of managers at the very early stages and help them become institutional quality investors, because that’s also development.”</p>
  <p>What does the LP want in a manager? “We’re looking for someone with experienced people, who adds value to portfolio companies and has investor discipline,” explains Preston. “We need to be able to trust they are going to get in at the right valuations and going to be able to contribute materially to the company’s strategy development through the board, as well as a strong vision for how they’re going to exit.” As a result, OPIC has a stronger focus on growth equity investors and less on buyout funds, where there’s “not a lot of new capital and primary shares going into the company”.</p>
  <p>Something that would put Preston off a fund would be a lack of alignment, both with its LPs or in the team. “That’s not a good signal for a 10-year relationship,” he says. “Also, if we find a manager that has a strategy that looks good on paper but is disconnected from the market and, for example, doesn’t have the networks, the insights or the experience to operate in those markets, that’s a major deterrent.”</p>

  <p class="text-info">The $14.6bn LA City Employees’ Retirement System has revealed more than $100m of commitments across private equity and real estate funds.</p>
  <p>LACERS has pledged $25m to TA Associates’ TA XII-A vehicle according to its August 11 board meeting minutes. The buyout house is believed to be targeting up to $4bn for Fund XII, which recently received a $30m commitment from the District of Columbia Retirement Board.</p>
  <p>LACERS also revealed two commitments of $10 to first-time funds 1315 Capital and New Water Capital, 1315 is eyeing up to $175m for its debut vehicle, while special situations firm New Water is targeting more than $400m. Real estate vehicles Morgan Stanley Prime Property Fund and Principal US Property Account, Clarion Lion Industrial Trust and Jamestown Premier Property Fund also all received $35m commitments.</p>

  <a id="chapter2-article3" class="anchor-hack"></a><h2>Landmark buys stake in TDR Capital Fund</h2>
  <p class="text-info">New York-based Neuberger Berman has sold its entire interest in a TDR Capital-managed fund to Landmark Partners, AltAssets can reveal.</p>
  <p>NB Secondary Opportunities Fund II, a 2008-vintage $1.7bn fund, sold its stake in TDR Capital II ‘A’ according to UK a regulatory filing. The fund is a side vehicle to TDR Capital II, a 2007 vintage fund which closed with commitments of €2.2bn according to its website. TDR Capital’s investors include various types of institution from a broad geographical base, including pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, fund of funds, insurance companies, endowments and foundations, family offices and individuals.</p>
  <p>Neuberger Berman sold the fund interest to Landmark Equity Partners XV and NCL Investments. Back in January, AltAssets reported that Landmark had held a $3.25bn final close for its fifteenth secondaries fund, a 40 per cent increase on the size of its last vehicle.</p>

  <a id="chapter2-article4" class="anchor-hack"></a><h2>BT’s pension scheme awards £1bn mandate to Hermes GPE</h2>
  <p class="text-info">BT’s pension scheme, one of the the UK’s largest occupational pension schemes, has awarded £1bn to Hermes GPE to invest in private equity.</p>
  <p>Hermes GPE is a specialist investor which has invested in private equity on behalf of clients for 25 years. It evolved out of a combining of the private equity businesses of Hermes Investment Management, which was originally founded to manage the BT pension fund’s assets, and the private equity assets of Gartmore, the UK asset manager that ran into difficulty after an IPO and was acquired by Henderson Global Investors. It is now jointly owned by Hermes Investment and the Hermes GPE management team.</p>
  <p>The £1bn allocation will be invested over three years, split evenly between funds and co-investments, Hermes GPE said in a statement on Monday, and invested on a global basis by Hermes GPE’s 16-strong investment team, which operates out of offices in London, New York and Singapore. Explaining its investment model, Hermes GPE said in its statement that it “optimises private equity exposure by combining globally sourced co-investments with commitments to primary funds”.</p>
  <p>It noted that it raised one of the largest co-investment funds of 2014, Hermes GPE PEC II, which closed at $480m last September. That fund is now approximately 82 per cent committed to 28 transactions, with a further three pending completion, and expects to be fully committed by the end of 2015, the company said. Hermes GPE has been constructing private equity portfolios for BTPS since 2000 in both funds and co-investments, and it is understood that it will continue to be the sole manager for BTPS in the PE asset class. The mandate brings Hermes GPE’s total private equity AUM to £4bn ($6bn), Hermes GPE said in its statement.</p>

  <a id="chapter2-article5" class="anchor-hack"></a><h2>Intesa Sanpaolo, Old Mutual, EIB help new Apis fund to $157m first close</h2>
  <p class="text-info">Intesa Sanpaolo, Old Mutual, CDC (UK) and the European Investment Bank are among a number of asset managers and institutions that have committed to Apis Partners’ inaugural Apis Growth Fund I, which has just announced its first close at more than $157m.</p>
  <p>Also committing to the fund thus far have been FMO (Netherlands) and Swedfund (Sweden), Apis said in a statement on Monday. The fund is targeting $250m. London-based Apis said it is seeking to attract investors who are looking to profit from direct access to innovative financial services businesses in Africa and South Asia, particularly in what it calls the “last-mile” distribution sector, and from the regions’ favourable demographics and “macro-economic fundamentals”. Udayan Goyal, Apis co-founder and managing partner, said: “Of the 2.5 billion unbanked adults globally – [more than] half of the world’s adults (2.2 billion) reside in growth markets.</p>
  <p>“Financial inclusion has a direct, measurable impact on GDP growth as well as offering an enormous, untapped market, expanding further thanks to the confluence of demographic and macroeconomic growth factors. We are firmly convinced that financial services will deliver in the next decade the same level of return on investment as the telecom boom in Africa and South Asia of the last two decades, [and so] we aim to bring that opportunity to our investors.”</p>
  <p>This time last year the firm hired another three people to expand its private equity infrastructure team. Former Rochschild investment banker Babaola Omiyale joined as an investment manager, Lewis Haffey as an investment analyst and Aaron Donoghue as engineering and project operations consultant.</p>

  <p>Genstar committed a meaningful amount of additional capital to Genstar Capital Partners VII, which brings the firm’s total capital commitments to more than $5bn. The vehicle received an increase in commitments from its existing investors according to source with knowledge of the matter, with new investors coming from Europe, Asia and the Middle East.

  <p>Genstar Capital Partners VII is over double the size of its predecessor, which closed on $912m back in January 2013. Managing director Ryan Clark, said, “We are very pleased with the strong performance of our prior funds and the support of our existing investors which enabled us to successfully raise Fund VII. “This new capital positions us well to pursue the strong pipeline of investment opportunities we have identified, and we are confident we have the team to execute our strategy and continue delivering value for our investors.”</p>
  <p>The fund will focuses on investments in targeted segments of the financial services, software, industrial technology, and healthcare industries. Evercore Private Funds Group acted as exclusive global placement agent for Genstar Capital Partners VII. Earlier this year, the US buyout house geared up for the fundraising by promoting three to managing director, with specialisms in the industrials, financial services and software sectors.</p>

  <p>TPG hopes to raise $400m for Pace Holdings according to a filing with the US securities regulator, with potential for another $60m sold by underwriters if demand passes that figure. The company said, “While we may pursue an acquisition opportunity that does not fit with TPG’s mandate in any business industry or sector, we intend to capitalise on the ability of our management team to identify, acquire and operate a business that is not operating at its full potential.”</p>
  <p>TPG will control one fifth of the business following the IPO, the filings adds. Earlier this year it emerged that the buyout house had pulled in $6.5bn for its latest mega fund, thanks to commitments from LPs including the Teachers’ Retirement System of Louisiana. Other LPs in the fund include the Oregon Public Employees Retirement Fund and Washington State Investment Board.</p>
  <p>TPG collected $2bn for a bridge vehicle last year which will be rolled into the Fund VII pool. The firm has offered a management fee discount of up to 25 per cent for the largest and earliest LPs in Fund VII, buyout added.</p>

  <p class="text-info">In an increasingly challenging fundraising environment, financial services-focused private equity firm Patriot Financial Manager has closed its second fund on $305m, according to Patriot contact Stefanie Langer.</p>
  <p>Patriot Financial Partners II received commitments from a variety of institutional and individual investors, with the GP commitment accounting for approximately 4 per cent of total commitments. The rest came from; “public and private plans, taft hartleys, fund of funds, foundations and high net worth individuals”, according to Langer, with all coming from the US.</p>
  <p>She told AltAssets, “There is clear appetite for industry focused funds, but that ebbs and flows over time with economic and industrial cycles. “Many investors have a level of familiarity with financial services, but thought that the most attractive time frame for investing was just after the GFC when pricing was significantly depressed. Patriot’s investment thesis and skill set doesn’t require that level of distress for implementation.”</p>
  <p>In September 2013, AltAssets reported that the firm had launched the investment vehicle with a $300m target, and just last month, the firm had pulled in $293m according to a filing with the US securities regulator. Langer added, “The fundraising environment has certainly gotten more challenging, especially for smaller groups. Brand name recognition and economies of scale make a difference in what has become a more mature and institutionalised private equity market. For us, the key was finding our audience and deploying capital to show proof of concept.”</p>
  <p>The firm also manages predecessor Patriot Financial Partners, which was established in 2007 and closed on $300m. To date it completed 23 investments in companies including Square 1 Financial, BNC Bancorp and Guaranty Bancorp. Like its predecessor, Fund II will target value oriented, growth and special situation investments in public or private community banks, typically those with assets less than $5bn, and related non-bank financial services companies across the US. According to Langer, Fund II will make around 20 core investments.</p>

  <p class="text-info">Hermes GPE expects to first close its third co-investment fund before the end of 2015, as it targets $300m, according to a published report.</p>
  <p>The private equity division of Hermes Investment Management could, however, raise as much as $500m, Hermes GPE head of private equity Peter Gale was quoted as saying. Hermes GPE PEC II, which closed at $480m in 2014, is about 82 per cent invested, having made 28 transactions and with a further three pending completion. PEC II was open to clients other than the BT Pension Scheme, and its third vehicle will be as well, Gale was quoted as saying.</p>
  <p>Hermes GPE is owned jointly by Hermes Investment Management and the Hermes GPE management team, after it evolved out of a combining of the private equity businesses of Hermes Investment and the private equity assets of Gartmore, the UK asset manager that ran into difficulty after an IPO and was acquired by Henderson Global Investors in 2011. As reported, BT’s pension scheme, one of the UK’s largest occupational pension schemes, has awarded £1bn to Hermes GPE to invest in private equity.</p>
  <p>The £1bn allocation will be invested over three years, split evenly between funds and co-investments, Hermes GPE said in a statement announcing the mandate yesterday, and invested on a global basis by Hermes GPE’s 16-strong investment team, which operates out of offices in London, New York and Singapore.</p>
