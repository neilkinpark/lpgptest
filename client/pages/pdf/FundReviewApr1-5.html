<h1 id="chapter1">GPs and LPs face complications in changing private equity space</h1>
<p class="text-info">While fundraising is on the rise, capital is going to fewer general partners as limited partners face growing difficulties keeping tabs on a private equity world fragmenting by geography, specialisation and vehicle structure.</p>
<p>According to advisory group Triago’s latest quarterly review, general partners and limited partners are in danger of getting lost in a growing and changing private equity space. LPs need insights into market conditions, non-traditional opportunities, co-investments and more, while GPs must often fine-tune strategy, hone messages and devote greater resources to building LP relationships. Triago estimates net asset values across all categories of private equity funds rose three per cent on average in the three months through December 2012, handily beating negative performance for listed comparables of portfolio companies in the US, where the majority of the industry’s capital is invested.</p>
<p>The report expects private equity funds to post an 8.5 per cent average gain for 2012, versus modestly higher appreciation for publicly traded companies in the US and Europe. Fourth quarter performance, set against a one per cent drop for the S&P 500 stock index, was the result of record exits from U.S. portfolios and rising exits elsewhere. Fourth quarter American exits amounted to $57bn, 43 per cent of the annual US total. Globally, fourth quarter exits generated cash in excess of carrying value and off-set write-downs tied to the falling value of listed comparables. High exit levels in the US and Europe year-to-date should lead to further net asset value write-ups for the first quarter, it said, given GPs’ relatively conservative carrying values for portfolio companies.</p>

<h1>EVCA says much to be done about EU’s long-term economic plan</h1>
<p class="text-info">Europe’s private equity association sees the latest proposals for European economic development from the European Commission (EC) as helpful, but said they required much work.</p>
<p>In response to the EC’s Green Paper on long-term financing of the economy, the European Private Equity & Venture Capital Association (EVCA) said it liked the idea of a long-term investment fund vehicle, which, however, should not “detract from getting existing regulation right for long-term investors.” Speaking about the existing legislation, the EVCA said it can discourage investors from committing capital to long term ventures, while the current accounting standards to measure risks led to “artificial volatility” in asset classes that are usually held until maturity such as private equity.</p>
<p>On a positive note, the EVCA was pleased that the paper gave special attention to venture capital, noting that 40 per cent of funding for the industry comes from the public sector. It said it was crucial for the economy that long-term investors such as pension funds and insurance companies can also invest in Europe’s high-growth, innovative businesses. Dörte Höppner, EVCA secretary general, said, “Pension funds and insurers need access to private equity funds to help meet future liabilities. The economy, and the companies that drive it, need the patient capital that long-term investors can provide via private equity and venture capital firms. It is a positive development that the Green Paper recognises these challenges and the EVCA looks forward to addressing these issues in the coming months.”</p>
<p>Data compiled by the EVCA shows that private equity and venture capital funds have invested €233bn in Europe since 2007, funding 5,000 businesses per year the overwhelming majority of which are SMEs. In addition, private equity investors hold investments for five years on average, while institutional investments in listed companies exit their stakes in one year or less. Finally, according to Ernst & Young private equity investments in large European companies has improved their productivity by seven per cent.</p>

<h1>ESG takes further step up private equity agenda</h1>
<p class="text-info">ESG has taken a further step up the agenda with last week’s launch of a new environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) Disclosure Framework for private equity, following a 16 month consultation and drafting process that involved a group of more than 40 limited partners from 11 countries, 20 private equity associations, and ten leading general partners.</p>
<p>The ESG Disclosure Framework has been developed to help general partners better understand why limited partners want ESG related information, and to help rationalise the types of questions that LPs are increasingly asking GPs on ESG. The document outlines eight objectives common to many LPs who want more structured ESG disclosures within their private equity investments. The first five objectives relate to the fund due diligence process, and the next three relate to disclosures during the life of the fund. Guidance is also provided on the disclosure of information around unexpected events that might pose reputation risks to an LP, GP or portfolio company.</p>
<p>Tom Rotherham-Winqvist, director of private markets at Hermes Equity Ownership Services, who chaired the drafting process, said, “This is an example of what can be achieved within the private equity sector when there is a common interest, mutual respect and a commitment to finding pragmatic solutions. This will help give LPs better insights into the management of underlying portfolio companies – something a growing number believe is needed to fulfil their fiduciary duty.”</p>
<p>Along with private equity associations, the drafting group benefited from close contact with the Board of the International Private Equity Valuations (IPEV), the Institutional Limited Partners Associations (ILPA) and the UN-backed Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI). Réal Desrochers, senior investment officer, CalPERS Private Equity said, “ESG is a strategic priority across the CalPERS investment portfolio. This disclosure framework will help clarify and define the information needed by limited partners in order to assess how private equity firms manage ESG risks and opportunities across their portfolio.”</p>
<p>Ruulke Bagijn, CIO – private markets at PGGM, added, “Responsible investing is one of our investment beliefs. For it to become practice, ESG disclosure is important, because what is disclosed, will be managed. We believe the ESG disclosure framework will lead to effective management of ESG risk and value creation. Moreover, the framework is an important step towards more coordination and alignment among the LP community.”</p>
<p>In all, 41 limited partners from 11 countries expressed formal support for the framework, namely AFL-CIO Office of Investment, AlpInvest, AP1, AP2, AP3, AP4, APG Asset Management, Aviva Investors, Axa Private Equity, Blue Sky Group, Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, Caisse des Dépôts, CalPERS, Capital Dynamics, CBUS, CDC Group, Hermes GPE, HESTA, IFC, Local Government Super, Lothian Pension Fund, Merseyside Pension Fund, MN, Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan, OPTrust Private Markets Group, Pension Protection Fund, PREVI, Public Sector Pension Investment Board, Pantheon, PGGM, PKA, Robeco Private Equity, RPMI Railpen Investments, SEIU Master Trust, South African Government Employee Pension Fund, SPF Beheer, Storebrand, Syntrus Achmea, Unipension, USS and VFMC.</p>
<p>Umberto Pisoni, portfolio head – private equity funds at IFC, said, “IFC is confident that corporate commitment to sustainability and transparency is associated with better business performance and better returns for investors; and therefore we welcome this framework as an important step towards a more structured ESG management of private equity investments.”</p>
<p>Iain Leigh, managing director, global private equity at APG added, “For APG it is vital that ESG factors are addressed across the whole investment cycle, to match our approach to integrating ESG factors into the investment process. We have been actively involved in the development of the framework. Supported by various key stakeholders this framework can help drive change and achieve greater consistency in ESG disclosures. As momentum gathers we expect more and more LPs and GPs to make ESG a standard component of performance reviews.”</p>

<h1>Brazil’s investment fundamentals still solid, despite growing pains</h1>
<p class="text-info">In the past two years Brazil’s growth trajectory has levelled off, and is struggling to match that of its BRIC peers. From a private perspective, the region has seen an influx of overseas buyout investors, leading to fears that it is overheating.</p>
<p>However, Brazil´s fundamentals remain solid, and continue to prove attractive to those investors that truly understand the region’s opportunities according to Clovis Meurer chairman of industry association Associação Brasileira de Private Equity & Venture Capital (ABVCAP). “We have an established and efficient legal system, a stable economy for more than 15 years and a capital market that is developed. BM&FBovespa is the fourth largest listed exchange in the world. Brazil is in great need of investments, which creates an opportunity for long-term capital. There is a large space for growth and returns in several sectors.”</p>
<p>In addition, he predicts that fundraising in 2013 should be stronger than in 2012, he says, “We have resources available and in a growth curve of the third year of [Brazilian president] Dilma Vana Rousseff´s term. Fundraising will also depend on the reaction of the GDP and the growth plans set by the government.” In terms of trends, he also foresees an increase of activities among large Brazilian institutional investors, alongside those foreign investors that operate directly in Brazil through their local offices, many of whom have recently established bases in the country.</p>
<p>“More local investors are looking to invest in private equity and venture capital through FIP [Fundo fi Investimento em Participação] funds as interest rates remain low. The large investors are the pension funds, family offices, banks and development agencies, in addition to international investors. They have to look for higher return options for their longer term portfolios.” And while there have been warnings that its private equity industry could be in danger of becoming overcrowded, particularly in the upper end of the market, the mid-market and growth capital side still look to be at a healthy level. Both early and later stage venture capital activity has also seen less competition and has a continued capacity for more investment.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the demand for infrastructure offers a huge opportunity, Meurer adds. “The demand for infrastructure investment is huge as the country prepares to host the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics. The Brazilian government is currently on roadshows presenting infrastructure projects in North America, Europe and other markets. There are several opportunities in ports, roads, logistics, energy, airports, which encourages public-private partnerships. “There is interest in several because of the competitive advantages we have due to a relatively young population of approximately 200 million people, a burgeoning middle class, low rates of unemployment, a solid democratic regime, diverse and abundant natural resources, huge areas available for farmland, a very favourable climate, among others.</p>

<h1>Georgia $100m venture fund bill passes State House</h1>
<p class="text-info">The US state of Georgia has moved a step closer to launching its own $100m venture fund, which now only requires the green light from governor Nathan Deal.</p>
<p>Georgia’s House of Representatives passed the venture fund bill by a 135-28 vote yesterday after gaining the approval of the State Senate a month ago. The fund is set to raise $100m over the next five years, including $10m in its first year and $15m per year in the following two years to invest in Georgia-based companies. At present, 92 per cent of venture capital investments in Georgia come from outside investors, according Georgia Tech’s Enterprise Innovation Institute. The publication quoted chief sponsor of the bill senator Tim Golden as saying, “Other states, because of these funds, are raiding Georgia companies after we get them established. This bill would hopefully help solve that problem once we get it up and running.”</p>

<h1>Cendana Capital closes $28.2m fund of funds after slashing target</h1>
<p class="text-info">San Francisco-based institutional seed investor Cendana Capital has now closed its fund of funds after trimming its target from $100m to $28.2m.</p>
<p>A document filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission showed that the Cendana Capital fund has raised $28.2m from 33 LPs, which is below its initial target of $100m revealed in another filing in January 2012. Back in July the firm reported that it had raised $60m for its Cendana Co-investment Fund from the University of Texas Investment Management Company. Cendana targets venture capital funds that invest in startup businesses. Some of Cendana’s investments include Freestyle Capital’s debut $27m vehicle. It has also invested in Accelerator Ventures, Forerunner Ventures, Founder Collective, IA Ventures, K9 Ventures, Lerer Ventures, PivotNorth Capital and SoftTechVC.</p>

<h1>Neuberger Berman bags almost $1bn for third secondaries fund</h1>
<p class="text-info">New York-based asset management firm Neuberger Berman has now raised almost $1bn for its third secondaries fund after receiving more than $250m of commitments from offshore investors, AltAssets has learned.</p>
<p>The Former Lehman Brothers asset management arm is raising its third fund via three vehicles, including the Caymans registered Secondary Opportunities Offshore Fund III. This vehicle has tapped 32 investors for $266.5m according to a document filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). A separate SEC filing a month ago revealed Neuberger had received commitments totalling $733.2m from 23 LPs for the NB Secondary Opportunities Fund III.</p>
<p>NB has also filed to raise an NB Secondary Opportunities Fund III-B vehicle, which has yet to register any commitments. Together, the vehicles have received $999.7m towards the fund’s $1.6bn target, just short of the $1.77bn Neuberger raised for its second fund just months before the collapse of Lehman Brothers. That second fund’s largest investor was the Universities Superannuation Scheme, the principal pension fund for UK universities, which committed $135m in 2010. In December last year Neuberger-backed private equity fund Dyal Capital Partners closed a $1.28bn vehicle to make minority investments in the managing companies of established hedge fund firms.</p> 
<p>Last month Neuberger’s peer LGT closed its $2bn third global private equity secondary fund, which it said was oversubscribed shortly after Deutsche Bank Private Equity said its Secondary Opportunities Fund II had raised $614m, topping the $500m target. In a report that came out in January, Altius Associates said the secondary market was on track to challenge the record fundraising year of 2009, as it becomes more mature and more efficient in the future. A separate report from secondary adviser Cogent Partners showed the average high first round bid for buyout funds was 84 per cent of NAV in the second half of 2012 – compared to 85 per cent in the first six months of the year. The annual volume of secondary deals in 2012 matched 2011’s record total of $25bn globally.</p>

<h1>Panda Power Funds launches second $800m energy fund</h1>
<p class="text-info">Dallas-headquartered investor in power projects Panda Power Funds has decided to give another try to raise an $800m fund, it emerged today.</p>
<p>The firm has started marketing its second energy fund that is aiming to raise $800m with a hard cap of $1bn, said Dow Jones, citing people with knowledge of the firm’s plans. The new vehicle follows the $420m Panda Power Generation Infrastructure Fund for investment in solar power and natural gas projects closed by the firm in November 2011 after being on the road for a year and a half. The first fund also targeted $800m, but wound up raising just over half as much.</p>
<p>Panda recently secured financing for the expansion of its Temple, Texas power plant to double its size to 1,516 megawatts. This would be enough to power 1.5 million homes in Central and North Texas. This was the firm’s third funding of a power plant project in eight months. Other projects backed by Panda include the 758 MW Sherman, Texas power plant.</p>

<h1>High returns help Arsenal Capital Partners top fundraising target</h1>
<p class text="text-info">Yielding returns of up to 12 times from its three latest exits has been “very helpful” for Arsenal Capital Partners’ latest fundraise, which topped the target by over $100m.</p>
<p>The firm has now closed its third buyout fund at $875mcompared with the $750m target to exceed the size of its $500 second fund by 75 per cent. Arsenal Capital Partners founding partner Terry Mullen said the main drivers behind investor demand for the New York-based firm’s latest fund were its focus on lower middle market buyouts and expertise in its target sectors. Mullen said, “There were a couple of things that worked in our favour. Small buyout became more in favour for a lot of good reasons; people recognize the value of high growth companies and the opportunity to add more value.” He added that having a narrow focus also helps, pointing out that Arsenal has built a team of in-house strategic and technical experts focused on the two sectors.</p>
<p>It also didn’t hurt that Arsenal had been yielding good returns from its recent exits including the sale of Fund II portfolio company Novolyte to BASF for a return of over four times in April 2012. The sale followed two exits that returned eight and twelve times, which Mullen said was “very helpful” for the fundraise. The firm’s first and second funds, vintage 2001 and 2006 respectively, have posted an IRR of 20.2 per cent and 22.5 per cent respectively. Mullen said the third fund is targeting similar returns, aiming to get a net return of two times from its investments.</p>
<p>The firm has brought 35 new institutional LPs on board for the new fund, of which 50 per cent are US based with the other half coming predominantly from Europe with a couple of LPs from Asia, making for less than 10 per cent of the total. While the firm will follow the same strategy as with its two previous funds, there will be changes due to the bigger size of the new vehicle. For every dollar invested from the second fund, co-investors – almost exclusively Arsenal’s existing LPs – contributed 65 cents.</p>
<p>As the third fund has more committed capital, the share of co-investments is set to drop to between 25 and 30 per cent. The firm will continue to back buyouts of lower mid-market companies with an EBITDA between $10m and $25m. The average investment size of the second fund – which is now fully committed – was $125m and that is also expected to remain the same with Arsenal planning to make 12 investments of $50m to $250m.</p>

<h1>Brookfield raises $1bn real asset fund, targets more</h1>
<p class text="text-info">Asset manager Brookfield has closed a $1bn private equity fund in one of the biggest fundraises in Canada in recent years and has said it is targeting a total capital raise of $5bn across a further six separate investment funds.</p>
<p>The firm, which focuses on real asset investment across renewable energy, property and infrastructure, closed the fund via its Brookfield Capital Partners private equity unit at the end of 2012. This fund will not build exposure to renewable energy assets but Andrew Willis, senior vice president at the firm, confirmed it will continue to make green investments through listed-division Brookfield Renewable Energy Partners and its infrastructure funds. </p>
<p>With $175bn under management, Brookfield operates across 20 countries and invests between 20 per cent and 40 per cent alongside its clients in private funds and co-investments. It has to date invested $19bn in renewable energy, principally in 176 hydropower plants alongside a smaller portfolio of seven wind farms. Although it has been increasingly spending on onshore wind in recent times – including the acquisition of Western Wind shares – earlier this year CEO of Brookfield Renewable Energy Partners Richard Legault was keen to stress its focus remains on hydropower.</p>
<p>It is most heavily exposed to property with $103bn committed to the sector with an additional $27m dedicated to infrastructure and $26m in its private equity arm. Between 2001 and 2010 it achieved a gross IRR of 26 per cent through private equity investments while infrastructure activities returned 17 per cent over the five-year period up to 2010. Nearly two-thirds of its investors are public pension or superannuation funds (61 per cent) with sovereign wealth funds constituting the next largest group at 14 per cent.</p>

<h1>Grotech nears $200m target for latest venture fund</h1>
<p class text="text-info">Veteran early stage investment firm Grotech Ventures is within touching distance of hitting its $220m target for its latest fund, AltAssets has learned.</p>
<p>The Virginia-based firm has gathered $202m of commitments for Grotech Ventures II according to a US securities filings, which shows 18 LPs have pledged to the vehicle to date. That total puts Grotech near to closing up the fund after 18 months on the road, the filing shows. The firm has managed more than $1bn of capital and funded over 100 companies since it was founded in 1984, and currently invests between $500,000 and $5m in promising businesses.</p>
<p>Grotech Ventures II is almost double the size of its last fund raised in 2007, which closed on $109m. But it is half the size of Grotech Partners VI raised at the height of the dotcom boom in 2000, and smaller than the $300m collected for Grotech Partners V in 1998. It is led by founder Frank Adams, who is also chairman emeritus of the Mid-Atlantic Venture Association he co-founded and acted as president of between 1986 and 1999. Grotech’s portfolio includes Windows backup and system recovery business Rebit, daily deals site Living Social and personal finance website HelloWallet.</p>
<p>Earlier this year the firm led a $7.5m Series A-1 round for retail stock management and marketing business Optoro. The company process and remarkets returned, overstock, and damaged-box products across popular online marketplaces such as eBay, Amazon, and Buy.com, connecting once idle products to hundreds of millions of secondary consumers. Grotech general partner Lawson DeVries said, “The market is demanding more liberal return policies, which is changing the economics for retailers. Optoro allows these retailers to extract far greater economics from ballooning returned goods inventory than existing methods of dealing with it. The OptiTurn platform can handle enormous volumes of inventory, which allows Optoro to target the industry’s largest players with the greatest need for this solution.”</p>

<h1>Carlyle raises $623m for second CLO fund for 2013</h1>
<p class text="text-info">Global alternative asset manager The Carlyle Group has closed a $623m collateralised loan obligation (CLO) fund, the firm’s second new-issue CLO of the year.</p>
<p>Carlyle Global Market Strategies CLO 2013-2 will again invest in corporate leveraged loans and high yield bonds. Morgan Stanley arranged the transaction. Carlyle’s first new-issue CLO fund of 2013 closed in February at $605m. The firm closed a total of four new-issue CLOs last year, raising $2.26 bn. CLO funds have proven popular amongst alternative asset managers. Just last week, Toronto-listed investment group Onex Corporation raised $512m for its third CLO offering, while UK buyout firm 3i raised $500m for its Jamestown II vehicle.</p>

<h1>American Capital inks $414m CLO deal</h1>
<p class text="text-info">Nasdaq-listed American Capital has closed on the sale of $414m of collateralised loan obligation bonds.</p>
<p>The transaction was arranged by Deutsche Bank Securities. The CLO is externally managed by American Capital Leveraged Finance Management, LLC, a subsidiary of American Capital Asset Management, a wholly-owned portfolio company of American Capital, for an annual management fee of 50 basis points of total assets. The CLO has primarily invested the proceeds of the bonds in broadly syndicated senior secured loans purchased in the primary and secondary markets, American Capital said.</p>
<p>“We are pleased that we materially improved pricing on the financing of our latest CLO versus the CLO that we raised last September,” said Mark Pelletier, American Capital managing director -  CDO and CLO Group. “We now manage three CLOs and have investments in the equity of 25 CLOs.” Malon Wilkus, American Capital Chairman and CEO, added, “With this new CLO, American Capital Asset Management continues to expand its funds under management and now manages six private funds and two public REITs.” The bonds sold by the CLO included AAA through B-rated tranches, and a non-rated equity tranche of subordinated notes. American Capital Leveraged Finance Management purchased $25.3m of the non-rated equity tranche of subordinated notes, with third party investors purchasing the remaining $11m.</p>

<h1>Morgenthaler, ATV life sciences spinout Lightstone confirms $250m target</h1>
<p class text="text-info">Lightstone Ventures has revealed it could raise up to $250m for its debut fund after being created by spinout investment teams from two other venture firms last year.</p>
<p>Morgenthaler Ventures and Advanced Technology Ventures spun out their life sciences teams respectively to form Lightstone in January 2012 citing a challenging environment for the sector. The firm already manages a portfolio of more than 50 medical device and biotechnology companies through legacy funds from its parent investment teams. It plans to use the eponymous new vehicle to target early-stage therapeutic companies, saying it was time “to energize the venture and healthcare industries by creating a premier therapeutic-oriented life science venture fund”.</p>
<p>Despite the firm’s concerns over the sector’s challenges there has been plenty of fundraising activity from rivals hoping to make their mark in the area. Life science-focused investment firm RiverVest Venture Partners appeared to be gearing up for marketing a new fund by trumpeting the performance of its second vehicle last month. The firm revealed Fund II yielded a 14.5 per cent per annum net IRR from its 2006 inception after fees and expenses, 10 per cent higher than the median net IRR for reporting venture funds of the same vintage according to research from advisory firm Cambridge Associates. </p>
<p>It also emerged last month that New York-based HealthCor Partners had tapped investors for $27m over the past 12 months to take the total raised for Partners Fund II to $81.5m. But Hopen Life Science Ventures is still gathering commitments for its second investment vehicle more than a year after it expected to hold a $50m final close. The US venture capital firm is now targeting $100m according to a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, which showed the fund had picked up just over $40m of commitments to date. Hopen Life Science Fund II has been gathering commitments for more than two years, having received its first set of pledges from LPs in January 2011.</p>
<p>Research by professional services firm PricewaterhouseCoopers earlier this year showed US venture capital funding in the life sciences sector had dropped in terms of dollars and deals done in 2012. While VC invested $6.6bn across 779 life sciences deals during the year, this was still a drop of 14 per cent in dollars and seven per cent in deals, compared with $7.7bn in 836 deals during 2011. The number of life sciences companies receiving VC funding for the first time reached the lowest level since 1995 with only 135 companies receiving funding in 2012. Compared to the prior quarter, life sciences venture funding rose 11 per cent in Q4 2012 to $1.9bn. </p>
<p>Deal volume also increased, rising 12 per cent to 187 deals compared to the prior quarter. Tracy Lefteroff, global managing partner of the venture capital practice at PwC US, said “The 2012 investment levels came in lower than what we saw during 2011. The pickup during the third quarter for biotechnology and for both industries during the fourth quarter wasn’t enough to outpace lower funding levels during the first half of 2012. Global economic uncertainty, capital intensity, regulatory risk, and more discriminating investors were all potential factors that weighed on sector performance for the year.”</p>

<h1>New look Ignition Partners closes slimmer fifth fund on $150m</h1>
<p class text="text-info">Early-stage venture capital firm Ignition Partners has closed its fifth fund on $150m after a significant restructuring saw it scale back its fundraising ambitions.</p>
<p>The Washington-based firm, which was co-founded by former Microsoft Windows veteran Brad Silverberg, collected $400m for its last vehicle in 2007, and $285m for its first institutional fund in 2001. Reducing the fund target helped Ignition complete a fast fundraise, however, with the Ignition Venture Partners V becoming oversubscribed in less than three months. The firm said investors in the vehicle included Adams Street Partners, returning and new university endowments, pension funds and investment firms.</p>
<p>Ignition lost three of its partners in 2009 when they left to form a new group called Ignition Capital. The core team behind the latest fund now consists of partners John Connors, Frank Artale and Nick Sturiale, who previously worked at JAFCO Ventures, Sevin Rosen Funds and the Carlyle Group respectively. Sturiale was brought on board to run a new office based in California to give the firm a larger Silicon Valley presence, it said. Connors, a former top Microsoft executive who served as its CFO, joined Ignition in 2005, while Artale, a longtime software-industry executive who has held top positions at companies including Citrix, XenSource and Microsoft, came on board in 2011.</p>
<p>Connors said, “With approximately $450m in distributions in the last 12 months, our firm has strong momentum going forward, and we are honored to receive such strong support and validation from our limited partners. We are extremely upbeat about the current market and view the recent string of successful, enterprise-software IPOs as the start of a decade-long run of innovation that will usher in major productivity enhancements, and new ways of doing business, for companies worldwide.” Tom Gladden, a partner at investor Adams Street Partners, said, “We applaud Ignition’s refined, more-focused approach to early-stage investing and believe the enterprise-IT landscape is poised to create important new companies and substantial new wealth.” Ignition exits include the IPO of big data company Splunk 12 months ago and the sales of StorSimple, Azaleos and Zenprise. The firm’s current investments include Cloudera, DocuSign, Parse, Hipmunk and Bromium. Ignition said its latest fund will invest more narrowly in areas such as consumerised enterprise software, cloud technologies and big data.</p>

<h1>Ocean Avenue Capital launches $100m fund</h1>
<p class text="text-info">Private equity firm Ocean Avenue Capital has launched a new fund targeting $100m, AltAssets has learned.</p>
<p>A document recently filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which was seen by AltAssets, showed that the Santa Monica, California-based firm has yet to register any commitments for the new vehicle. A source confirmed the fundraise and told AltAssets that the Ocean Avenue Fund II will target “inefficient markets” as defined by the size and complexity of the transactions. The source said Ocean Avenue will partner with sponsors to invest in small businesses as well as in complex situations. Earlier filings showed that the firm raised $40m for Fund II-A and $30m for Fund II-B in 2011 followed by a $40m Fund II-C the next year. The source told AltAssets that the new fundraise has nothing to do with these vehicles. Also in 2011, Ocean closed the Special Situations private equity fund after raising $100m from five LPs.</p>

<h1>Shell to spend ‘several hundred million dollars’ on corporate venture capital</h1>
<p class text="text-info">Oil major Shell has revamped its corporate venturing activities, setting up a successor to Shell Technology Ventures Fund 1 managed by Kenda Capital to back emerging technology companies and venture funds through an in-house team.</p>
<p>The oil giant said it was ‘ready to invest several hundred million dollars in emerging technology companies’ with the aim to accelerate the deployment of innovations that add value to the company’s operations. Its first venture fund was set up in 1998, which has backed clean technologies such as GlassPoint Solar, a company that taps heat from the sun to generate steam for enhanced oil recovery. The latest vehicle – Shell Technology Ventures – will make investments over the next six to eight years. It will source opportunities ‘from smarter exploration processes to enhanced extraction techniques’. The fund will invest in promising technology companies, spin-outs and externally-managed venture capital funds.</p>
<p>Gerald Schotman, executive vice president innovation, R&D and Shell chief technology officer, said, “Ideas from outside the organisation are critical to our open innovation approach to R&D. We want to enable the brightest and the best to develop their ideas, and benefit from Shell’s expertise and global reach, so that we can get these technologies up and running in our projects as fast as we can.” Areas of focus for the fund include gas production and conversion; geophysical imaging; chemical manufacturing and conversion; novel materials; enhanced oil recovery; and water treatment. It will also look at big data; oil and gas wells drilling and completion; sub-surface sensing; production in challenging environments; operational efficiency; and future energy technologies.</p>
<p>Geert van de Wouw, Shell Technology Ventures director, said, “We are looking to develop long-term mutually, beneficial partnerships with emerging technology companies, venture capital firms and corporate venturing organisations.” Alongside investment Shell said it can offer technical experts, a global research capability and customer and contractor base. The move follows a realignment of venturing activities by a number of major global corporates as they increasingly step in to fill the gap left by the exodus of traditional venture capital models. GE Ventures also carried out a similar revamp and said it would now grab an annual spend from parent group General Electric as it places a greater focus on securing access to new innovation through a centralised venture hub. </p>
<p>BP also chose to close 2012 with a rethink of its corporate venturing activities, renaming it BP Ventures with the exclusion of ‘alternative energy’ to reflect the division’s diversification of strategy. Graham Howes, an associate at the corporate venture capital unit, said, “BP Alternative Energy Ventures – as we were known – was all about cleantech, biofuels, carbon and wind. We were also about solar but we have divested our solar interests over the last year or so. We are now also looking for investments in oil and gas sector.” Shell said it is now accepting enquiries from technology firms with investment professionals based in the US, UK and the Netherlands.</p>

<h1>US Debt Ventures raising new fund amid rising US real estate confidence</h1>
<p class text="text-info">Distressed real estate investor US Debt Ventures has attracted 18 LPs as it targets $50m for its latest investment vehicle, AltAssets has learned.</p>
<p>The Florida-based firm has raised almost $17m for USDV Encore Fund according to a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. That filing showed each investor is being asked to part with at least $125,000. USDV attempts to pick up both performing and non-performing assets in the US distressed residential and commercial market according to its website. The firm is led by CEO and partner Todd Billings, who is the only person listed in the filing. Billings joined USDV in December 2010 to lead the firm’s corporate strategy, client acquisition, deal making, team building and marketing according to his LinkedIn page. He was previously CEO and founder of Veriloquent Wealth Advisors, a multi-family office for ultra high net worth families, between 2008 and 2011.</p>
<p>Last week private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management was reported to be looking to capitalise on an expected rebound in the US housing market by backing small investment firms focused on buying foreclosed homes. That move followed news that the Case-Schiler index, which tracks housing prices in America’s largest cities, had risen at the fastest pace since 2006 in January.</p>

<h1>CapMan to close €175m Russia II fund by end of the month</h1>
<p class text="text-info">Nordic private equity firm CapMan aims to close its €175m Russia II fund by April 2014 and could consider additional closes after inking a first close of €97m.</p>
<p>CapMan partner Alexander Vlasov also told AltAssets that the CapMan Russia II fund is targeting returns of three times, or an IRR of 30 per cent. In addition to the €97m already raised, the fund has already secured a further €20m from the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development, which has joined other LPs that include IFC. The fund has also secured the backing of US government-backed investor OPIC. CapMan’s and the team’s share of the commitments is €3m, or around three per cent. Vlasov added that there won’t be much of a change from the firm’s €118m previous Russia vehicle which was launched in 2008, but the average investment will probably increase. </p>
<p>He said, “We have no intent of changing the strategy that we have followed since the 1990s and will continue doing what our investors are expecting us to. There are no limits on closings and we could potentially hold more, but at the moment there are no fixed dates on interim closings. If our LPs prefer to hold on until the final close, then we’ll only have that.” He added that no investments have so far been signed, but the fund has a “strong pipeline” with a couple of deals in the final stage of due diligence. These are likely to be between €15m and €20m on average with the fund expected to make between eight and twelve investments. Vlasov said, “There is no strong focus on any specific sectors. We’re targeting areas that are showing growth such as consumer companies, telecommunications and services.”</p>

<h1>Swiss private equity firm CGS smashes target for €171m third fund</h1>
<p class text="text-info">Swiss private equity firm CGS has closed its third fund, CGS III, on CHF208m (€171m), exceeding its CHF180m hard cap.</p>
<p>In order to accommodate the actual level of demand, the existing investors consented to a moderate increase of the original hard cap, the firm said, which had been set at CHF200m. A number of potential further investors had to be declined in the last phase of the fundraising process. The fund will continue CGS’ strategy of pursuing buy-and-build acquisitions in German-speaking Europe. In March 2012, on the basis of an early first close, the fund made its first investment with the acquisition of Swiss-¬based Rauscher & Stoecklin , a manufacturer of electrical components for infrastructure. In February it made a second investment with the formation of German-based Top-Werk with its two subsidiaries SR Schindler and Prinzing, two manufacturers of machinery and systems for the concrete industry.</p>
<p>Ashley Le Feuvre, a director of the fund’s managing general partner, said, “On the backdrop of a rather difficult fundraising environment, we are delighted with the very favorable final closing of CGS III. This success is a reflection of CGS’ consistently applied industrial approach and the resulting attractive returns its funds have provided to investors. Together with our trusted partners of CGS Management, we look forward to building an equally attractive portfolio for CGS III in the coming years.”</p>

<h1>Idea Capital closes sustainable growth fund on €100m target</h1>
<p class text="text-info">Italian private equity firm Idea Capital Funds has closed its Idea Energy Efficiency and Sustainable Growth fund on its target of €100m.</p>
<p>According to Federico Cellina, head of marketing and institutional sales at the firm, the past year proved the toughest period of fundraising he has ever experienced. “We are grateful to our limited partners for their trust which enabled us to reach such a remarkable achievement during one of the most challenging fundraising environment ever,” Cellina said. The fund attracted a total of 15 backers, mainly domestic, including its sponsor Dea Capital, three insurance companies, two banks, two pension funds, one listed company and the remainder a series of wealthy entrepreneurs and family offices.</p>
<p>“We are all facing a very tough environment so to hit our target was a very positive result. The amount of work the team has put in – especially over the past three months – has been exceptional. €100m was an ambitious goal, but it was something we all were committed to achieve for guaranteeing the original investment strategy declared to our LPs.” He added, “It is now almost impossible to get a plain vanilla ticket – every client wants tailor-made solutions that suits them before committing capital.” He said in closing it off there were ‘as usual, few surprises both positive and negative’ in the limited partners that committed capital.</p>
<p>The focus of the fund is on providing expansion and growth capital, and later stage investments to small-medium leading enterprises manufacturing products or delivering services for better exploitation of energy and natural resources in general. At least 70 per cent of the capital will be allocated to Italian companies and the remainder split across Germany, Switzerland and Israel. With Italy’s GDP shrinking for the second year in a row, the team will focus on companies whose revenues come mainly from export.</p>
<p>The fund has already completed two investments and will be closing a third shortly in the e-mobility sector in a company that is commercializing a drive-train for electric motor bikes. Cellina said that the team – led by Sergio Buonanno – was keen to hit the ground running in allocating capital to overcome resistance from LPs that it was a first-time fund and prove its strategy works in practice, not just on paper. He anticipates making a total of between eight and ten investments, and it will look to hold significant minority positions of up to 49 per cent in each portfolio’s company or possibly take control.</p>

<h1>Finland courts venture capital investors to help kickstart economy</h1>
<p class text="text-info">Finland is reportedly turning to venture capital in an attempt to kickstart the country out of recession through a $1bn startup programme.</p>
<p>The new fund is designed to attract private investors willing to take on the risk of helping new companies the government cannot afford to support without increasing its budget deficit, Bloomberg said. It quoted Petri Peltonen, the Finnish Economy Ministry’s head of enterprise and innovation, as saying the debt crisis had caused investors to shy away from backing early-stage businesses. He said, “We’re now trying to attract private investors to take more risk that will help boost economic growth and create jobs.” Investors in the vehicle have been promised they will receive the vast majority of profits from the scheme, Bloomberg added. </p>
<p>Early-stage and growth companies across Europe have suffered following the financial crisis amid lending drying up and investors looking to less risky assets to grow their capital. Last month the UK Government announced a plan to plough an extra £75m into venture capital funding by extending a pair of programmes aimed at supporting startups and early-stage businesses. Chancellor George Osborne revealed in 2013 UK Budget that the Enterprise Capital Fund and Business Angel Co-Investment Fund programmes would both be extended.</p>
<p>Between them both funds aim to fill an investment gap between £100,000 and £2m, with BACIF operating up to the £1m mark and ECF backing business above that point. About £166m has been committed to small and medium-sized businesses in the UK to date through ECF according to fund manager Capital for Enterprise, while £50m was originally earmarked for the BACIF in November 2011. BACIF will see its capital doubled to £100m under the new Budget, while an extra £25m has been made available to ECF for a venture capital fund called Catalyst.</p>

<h1>Carlyle set to launch India fund, financial services company</h1>
<p class text="text-info">US buyout major Carlyle is reportedly preparing to raise a fund targeting Indian businesses and launch a non-banking financial company (NBFC).</p>
<p>The fund is expected to target the retail, defence and insurance that don’t get much attention from foreign investors, said the Economic Times. It also noted that such strategy of raising a fund and providing banking services via an NBFC is being increasingly adopted by large private equity firms including KKR, Everstone Capital and Warburg Pincus. Fellow private equity firm Avendus Capital has recently acquired an NBFC and is currently raising a $25m fund for the unit following the launch of its India Opportunities Fund III. Other firms that have recently bought stakes in Indian NBFC include ChrysCapital and IFC. In November Carlyle, which has an office in Mumbai, was reported to be bidding for a controlling stake in Indian electronic payments business Prizm Payments and eyeing minority.</p>

<h1>Indiareit to launch $300m fund next month, makes two investments</h1>
<p class text="text-info">Piramal Enterprises’ private equity arm Indiareit has invested INR2bn ($36.6m) in real estate projects across India from its two funds and is reportedly set to launch a $300m offshore fund next month.</p>
<p>The offshore fund initially targeted $500m, but Indiareit managing director Khushru Jijina told the Business Standard that $300m is more appropriate given the current market conditions.

This is not the Indiareit’s first investment in Omkar, which received INR2bn from the firm in September 2011. The other INR1bn was invested in Marvel Group from Indiareit’s INR9bn Domestic Scheme IV fund. Marvel is currently working on several projects in Pune, Balgalore and Mumbai. Jijina said, “Both these transactions are representative of the attractive returns that we are able to structure in the market today, with the added benefit of mechanisms in place to protect downside and provide adequate security cover.”</p>

<h1>Malaysian government to support Azka Capital’s $500m halal food fund</h1>
<p class text="text-info">The Malaysian government is to back a $500m fund focused on the halal food sector, according to Prime Minister Tun Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, the News Straits Times has reported.</p>
<p>“The demand for halal products and services is expected to increase with the growth of the Muslim population and increasing awareness of the halal standard,” he said. Investments will be made via Azka Capital, Kuala Lumpur-based a private equity advisory firm focused on halal industry initiatives.

<h1>Zephyr Peacock holds $70m second close for India Fund III</h1>
<p class text="text-info">Mid-market private equity investor Zephyr Peacock has held a $70m second close for its latest India-focused fund, AltAssets has learned.</p>
<p>Zephyr Peacock India Fund III expects to keep raising capital until at least the fourth quarter of this year according to two sources with knowledge of the fundraise, who said it was hoping to collect between $100m and $150m. The firm had already outstripped the $48m it gathered for its debut India fund launched in 2006, having held a $50m first close for the latest vehicle 12 months ago. One of the sources said the firm had been caught up in a wider bearishness from LPs about India in the past year or so amid negativity about investments in the country being able to grow and exit. Commitments so far are believed to have come from pension funds and family offices, split roughly 50-50 between the US and overseas LPs.</p>
<p>A second source revealed Zephyr was finally expecting to hold a long-planned IPO of portfolio company Trimax amid a pickup in the country’s public markets. The firm hopes to float the IT company in the third quarter, more than two years after it emerged plans were afoot to list the business. Trimax, which provides IT services to government agencies and enterprises, became part of Zephyr’s portfolio through a $10m investment in 2006. That deal came a year after Trimax raised an undisclosed sum from BanyanTree Growth Capital Fund for a 10 per cent stake in the business.</p>
<p>Zephyr is also eyeing a secondary sale of a portfolio company to another private equity investor, and a strategic sale of a third business according to the second source. The firm has attempted to avoid rising valuations in the Indian market by concentrating on the lower mid-market end of the buyout scale, investing between $5m and $20m in companies with strong financial performance results and proven business models. It has made one full exit to date through the sale of aluminium die-casting company Maxop Engineering in May 2011.</p>

<p class text="text-info">Sydney-based private equity firm Anchorage Capital Partners has held a first and final closing of its second fund on A$250m ($264m).</p>
<p>Anchorage Capital Partners II will continue the firm’s strategy of focusing on special situations and turnaround investments in the Australian, New Zealand and Southeast Asian markets.

<h1>Gulf Capital seals $20m IFC commitment for MENA credit fund</h1>
<p class text="text-info">Middle East alternative investment firm Gulf Capital has received a $20m anchor investment for its credit and mezzanine fund from the International Finance Corporation (IFC).</p>
<p>The commitment brings the total investments in the Gulf Capital Credit Opportunities Fund to $215m, marking it as the largest credit fund in the Middle East. Gulf Capital Credit Opportunities Fund will seek to lend to companies in various sectors including infrastructure, healthcare, education, and manufacturing. The investment agreement with the IFC will help provide long-term financing to small and medium enterprises in Turkey and the Middle East and North Africa, expand access to finance and create jobs. The successful third close of Gulf Credits Partners’ maiden regional credit fund has already attracted commitments from institutional investors and family offices from the region and around the world, the firm said. Launched by Gulf Capital in late 2011, the fund provides aims to provide liquidity and growth capital for regional SMEs and companies, as well as acquisition finance for private equity firms. </p>
<p>“More than half of small and medium businesses in the Middle East and North Africa don’t have access to credit,” said K. Aftab Ahmed, IFC director for financial markets and private equity funds, for Europe, Central Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa. “IFC’s investment in Gulf Credit will facilitate the availability of much-needed mezzanine financing in the region to businesses. Investments such as these can help accelerate growth and strengthen good governance.” This investment builds on a long-standing relationship between IFC and Gulf Capital, which have co-invested in companies in MENA since 2008. Those firms include Metito, a global water utility company, and SES Power, a mobile power provider.</p>
<p>Dr Karim El Solh, CEO, Gulf Capital, said, “The credit business is a very important part of Gulf Capital’s long-term growth plans and the IFC’s anchor investment is a strong vote of confidence in the Fund’s investment strategy. This third successful closing, particularly in a difficult fund raising environment, emphasises the appeal of this fund to investors looking for high cash-yielding investments and strong potential upside. On the lending side, our corporate customers will benefit significantly from the flexible financing solutions and innovative structures that Gulf Credit Partners and the credit fund will be able to deliver.”</p>
<p>Walid Cherif, managing director and co-head of Gulf Credit Partners, added, “The shortage in regional liquidity is encouraging companies to seek new solutions to finance their growth plans. More sophisticated, cash-flow based lending is needed to meet those demands for capital. We are very delighted to have IFC on board with us as an investor. This investment will mean we can provide greater access to finance to entrepreneurs, who may otherwise find that the lack of financing impairs their ability to function and grow and contribute to the overall economy and job creation.”</p>
<p>He added, “We are also pleased to have helped the two companies already in our portfolio to achieve those goals with a bespoke financing solution for their needs. We are gratified by the level of support shown to us by leading global and regional investors.” Gulf Credit Partners’ fund aims to address an “acute” gap in the market for MENA financing by offering credit to corporate and private equity investors. The credit fund has already invested in private equity-backed acquisitions and growth capital for companies where debt and mezzanine finance is an alternative to equity. Investments in corporate loans and bonds will also be considered, the firm said.</p>
