<h1 id="chapter1">Wave of mid-market funds continue their return to market</h1>
<p class="text-info">Although a number of firms struggled to reach closings last year, the UK lower mid-market continues to boast a number of high-profile fundraising success stories.</p>
<p>ISIS Equity Partners and Inflexion wrapped up their primary and co-investment funds respectively within a matter of weeks, while LDC spin-off NorthEdge Capital, Dunedin, Palatine Private Equity and Lyceum Capital all reached first closes. A number of firms also launched their latest funds, including August Equity Partners and RJD Partners. But fundraising cycles and a number of investment period extensions due to the slow pace of investment or portfolio issues in the wake of the financial crisis have meant that many of the bigger names associated with the space have not been looking for capital. “A lot of the key names haven’t been out there fundraising, so it’s been somewhat of a slow year,” said Kelly DePonte, a managing director at Probitas Partners. “This means that some LPs are saving their capital for 2013, when a wave of funds will come back to the market.” Sources said firms such as Graphite Capital, Phoenix Equity Partners, Primary Capital and Darwin Private Equity are all due to return to the market at some point in 2013. </p>
<p>Deal volume fell 12 per cent to 79 buyouts in 2012 compared to the previous year, according to research from Lyceum Capital and Cass. Although the first six months of 2012 were buoyant, with total volume consistent with the 45 deals completed in H1 2011, the second half of the year saw deal flow slow to 33 buyouts, compared to 45 in 2011. “Deal volumes are down again,” said Simon Turner, a managing partner at Inflexion. ”Some of the key advisors let a lot of people go last year, and that’s an interesting indication of the volumes and activity levels not returning to the norm. You’ve seen a lot of firms overpaying for those reasons rather than for the quality of the underlying asset – whether they’re trying to trigger a new fundraising or burn off capital overhang. We’re still seeing slightly irrational prices for some of those businesses. It’s pretty challenging now.”</p>

<h1 id="chapter2">Silicon Valley venture confidence up despite flagging LP funding</h1>
<p class="text-info">An improved IPO market and high expectations for new opportunities in disruptive technologies has seen optimism in the Silicon Valley venture capital industry grow for the fourth quarter in a row, a new survey has shown.</p>
<p>Life sciences also perked up thanks to a much improved exit performance in the second quarter according to the Silicon Valley Venture Capitalist Confidence Index, which surveyed 29 San Francisco Bay Area venture capitalists in June. It said declining uncertainty in the macro environment made business investment decisions easier and was supporting confidence, but added there was still concern over a challenging funding environment through a fall in LP funding. Venky Ganesan of Menlo Ventures told the survey, “We are in the midst of a long-term bull trend for high growth venture backed companies. One of the fundamental drivers of returns in an asset class is the supply demand balance and right now the supply demand balance is very much in favor of investors. Cloud, mobile and social are fundamental, once in a generation trends, that will drive returns for a long, long time.”</p>
<p>Jeb Miller of Jafco Ventures said he saw a “massive opportunity for startups to emerge as category leaders in the cloud, mobile and big data markets, with the Bay Area remaining the epicenter of activity”. John Malloy of BlueRun Ventures concurred, noting that “mobile and cloud continue to be disruption drivers”, while Alain Harrus of Crosslink Capital indicated that “the software ecosystem continues to grow at breakneck speed”. The funding and fund-raising aspects of the venture business model appear to be lagging, however. Debra Guerin Beresini of invencor said, “We are headed for the summer doldrums. Although several VC-backed companies went public in the first half of the year, new venture fundings declined a bit. With this and the fact that most investors take vacation in July and August, the market should be slow over the summer. This is to be expected, though, and does not erode my confidence of the market gaining speed in the Fall.”</p>
<p>Bob Bozeman of EastLake Ventures reported “good quality in opportunities seen (generally less fluff) offset against slowness in fundings for new enterprises (an alarming 4 per cent of total investment capital).” Meanwhile, Dag Syrrist of Vision Capital reasoned that “the inexplicable enthusiasm for gadget and app investments is concerning in that the valuations and froth seen there are likely to make it hard for new companies who actually seek to build or develop something of value past Thanksgiving will find it hard to raise capital.”</p>

<h1 id="chapter3">Private equity firms open up in the race to prove differentiation</h1>
<p class="text-info">As private equity matures as an industry, gaining greater sophistication and efficiency, being able to offer true differentiation in a hyper-competitive market is proving more challenging than ever.</p>
<p>Firms are always on the lookout for ways to set themselves apart from the rest of their competitors and gain that elusive edge, according to Christopher Ullman, managing director at the and director of the firm’s global communications. Transparency is just the latest theme, he says. “Our money is just as green as Blackstone’s, TPG’s or KKR’s – the rates of return are pretty similar. We’re always looking to differentiate ourselves in the marketplace, though, and when a public pension fund is considering where to deploy capital, issues such as transparency are definitely things they now consider.” These issues are something that LPs are increasingly taking into account, he says. “Pension funds have their own constituencies to deal with, and they in turn are looking to understand better who they are doing business with. “They do consider factors other than performance and we are trying to bring about other differentiators that can help with fundraising and hiring.” </p>
<p>These could translate to tangible business benefits, as a private equity firm’s position or reputation as an investor or business owner could make the difference when it comes to a competitive bidding process for an attractive deal opportunity. Ullman adds, “If your brand in the marketplace is not well regarded, then a business owner that has spent decades building a company is unlikely to view you as a potential partner. Increasingly we feel there is a business advantage to being transparent. We want to be perceived well and for people to want to form partnerships with us.”</p>

<h1 id="chapter4">Separate accounts could solve China’s private equity problem</h1>
<p class="text-info">Separate managed accounts have the potential to fix what is manifestly broken in China private equity, writes Peter Fuhrman of China First Capital.</p>
<p>Separate accounts would give LPs what they want, access to good investment opportunities in China, but with little or none of the high risk, waste, misaligned incentives of blind pool investing in a typical private equity firm in China. From an LP perspective, the advantages of a managed account are numerous. The three key ones are lower fees, greater ability to hold the investment team accountable, and a portfolio more specially tailored to its needs, including the timing of liquidity events. In private equity terms, separate managed accounts are more like no-load index funds than fat-fee mutual funds. Leverage and gains are transferred to the people whose money is at risk, not the ones who manage it.</p>
<p>The private equity industry is as ripe for this kind of disruption as the mutual fund industry was in the 1970s when John Bogle began offering index funds at Vanguard. Bogle stripped out most of the fees and overheads charged by traditional mutual fund companies, and so let investors keep more of what they earned. He showed that paying “superstar fund managers” to build a portfolio was usually nothing more than a colossal waste of money. Bogle’s ideas and business model took a while to catch on. The traditional mutual fund industry fought it every step of the way. But, today, Vanguard is the largest, as well as the most admired mutual fund company in the world. John Bogle hasn’t gotten particularly rich doing this. But, he has made millions of dollars for millions of others.</p>
<p>My guess is if John Bogle and Vanguard wanted to get into private equity, they would set up a business to provide separate managed accounts. The “two-and-twenty” approach of most PE and VC firms has come under increasing pressure everywhere. LPs, often with large unfunded liabilities, are under ever greater pressure to improve returns. Overall, PE and VC has a pretty good record of producing returns above the basic hurdle rate of around five to eight per cent a year. This is especially true when returns are based on a PE firm’s own “marked-to-market” valuations. Actual cash-on-cash returns are usually lower, because exits are not common enough. </p>
<p>Once you subtract the GP’s fees and cut of the profits, an LP’s returns, especially when you factor in a liquidity premium, is often not a lot to get excited about. For LPs, cash returns are what matter most. Pension funds and insurance companies need to disperse real cash every month not marked-to-market audit statements of a PE fund’s notional investment returns. If done well, an LP investing through a separately managed account can get all the performance and diversification benefits of PE investing, but at lower cost, with greater control, both over the outlays of cash and the kind of deals being done. In China, the appeal of separately managed accounts should be particularly strong. We’re now seeing — and LPs feeling most of the pain — of the problems, distortions and heavy risks inherent in the current model of private equity in China.</p>
<p>PE firms raised tons of money by rightly pointing to China’s attractions as an emerging market — huge population and market, with economic growth far higher than in Europe and the US, and a large number of strong, private sector companies hungry for capital. There was also a legacy of very lucrative PE deals done during the industry’s early years in China, including investments in China’s main search company Baidu, as well as Shenzhen Commercial Bank, Pingan Insurance. To gain access to Chinese investment opportunities, LPs were persuaded to accept a level of risk that they might ordinarily shun. PE investing in China, they were told, is different, with opaque regulations, shifting government policies, a business environment rife with corruption and cronyism, primitive capital and debt markets. The PE and VC firms were often either newly-formed, or familiar names like Kleiner Perkins, Sequoia, KKR staffed with local Chinese-speaking teams who operated more like franchisees.</p>
<p>Hundreds of PE firms crowded into China. Almost all chose to adopt the identical investment strategy and target the same kinds of companies — those that looked the likeliest to have an IPO. Two hundred billion dollars was poured into over 10,000 Chinese companies. It turned out in many cases to be among the blindest forms of blind pool investing ever — a lottery ticket strategy in search of lottery returns. The result is $100bn or more of LP capital now stranded inside illiquid investments. A large proportion of these deals will likely not exit before the expiry date of the fund. That represents a serious problem for LPs. For most LPs, liquidity is a paramount concern. PE investing in China seems to have lost sight of that, with its reliance on IPOs as a single unhedged exit strategy. Even at its high point six years ago, IPOs were a low probability outcome. Fewer than half the PE deals done in 2007 exited through IPO. Following that, the number of deals done each year grew by over 50% from the 2007 amount, while the number of IPOs peaked in 2010.</p>
<p>Incentives don’t often get more perversely misaligned than those between PE firms in China and the LPs they invested for. The PE firms got fees, profit shares and very little scrutiny. Once a year or so, they marked-to-market their illiquid investments. This helped persuade LPs all was well. In my experience, China GPs often focused more on keeping the fees coming in, including by continuously raising money, and less on achieving reliable and timely exits for current LPs. Had LPs been investing through separate managed accounts, there is far less likelihood any of this would have occurred. The LPs would have assessed more closely each deal that was being done, and put money only into deals that closely matched the LPs specific appetite for risk and timetable for achieving liquidity.</p>
<p>Better safeguards would have likely been put in place to make sure investments had a “put clause” that was more enforceable than the one used in the majority of PE deals in China. Done properly, the “put” allows an investor to sell shares back to the company after several years if all other exit channels are blocked. In other words, it places front and center, in any PE deal, that eventual liquidity is a minimum requirement. LPs accept that investing in private equity and venture capital carries higher risks than buying publicly-traded securities. They also know that every PE portfolio will have its share of losers. But, where China PE is unique is in having such a high percentage of investments in flourishing businesses where the PE stake is illiquid, and unliquidatable within the remaining life of the fund.</p>
<p>In many cases, the investee companies used the PE money wisely, and have grown in the years since. They might like to have an IPO at some point, of course, but it isn’t necessary for their survival. The PE money is stuck inside. It’s not yet a crisis for the company. It is a crisis for the PE firms, and even more for the LPs, since it’s their money that’s now unrecoverable. As a rule, the fees paid to managers for separate managed accounts are lower than those paid to a GP. The profit carry is also usually lower. The spread between gross and net returns will be far narrower. This will help LPs close what, for many, is a widening gap between current performance and future unfunded liabilities. Although separate managed accounts seem an ideal business model for alternative investing in China, it may prove extremely difficult for LPs to find competent firms to provide the service. The economics of a typical PE fund are, of course, far more favourable for GPs than LPs. Separate managed accounts would reverse this.</p>
<p>John Bogle built the world’s largest and most successful mutual fund company by putting investors first, by chopping out wasteful fees, hidden charges, huge salaries, bonuses and overheads. He saw what was wrong with the mutual fund industry, that it was achieving mediocre results for investors while making huge piles of money for itself. He met a need, and for forty years now, he and Vanguard have done well by those who trusted them with their money. China private equity needs a John Bogle. Will it get one?</p>

<h1 id="chapter5">FPPA commits $55m to four private equity funds</h1>
<p class="text-info">While the bulk of private equity funds raised for investments in India are currently pooled in offshore countries with attractive tax and regulatory frameworks, such as Mauritius and Singapore, if India is to compete with global financial hubs the government must formulate a foreign investment policy that gives foreign investors a sense of comfort while choosing India as a location to pool funds, according to a recent EY report – Private equity: breaking borders.</p>
<p>Private equity investments in India outplayed all sources of capital in the first decade of the 21st century. Only $1.3bn was raised through IPOs in 2012 (excluding IPOs by public sector undertakings), compared with $7.6bn through private equity investments. Since India is expected to be the second largest economy in the world by 2050, and requires $1tn to spend on infrastructure within the next five years, private equity investments must be encouraged to meet the country’s economic needs.</p>
<p>Private equity firms have invested about $7.5bn in India over 415 deals in 2012, compared to the $9.6bn they invested across 446 deals the year before, which is a decrease in value of 21.8 per cent. The total investment by private equity firms over the past five years in India now stands at about $39.8bn across 1,820 transactions. Sudhir Kapadia, national tax leader, EY, said, “The current regulatory and tax framework for PE funds needs suitable amendments to facilitate the smooth inflow and repatriation of capital from the country. The government needs to put in place a simple and robust framework that does not cast unnecessary compliance burden on foreign investors. Moreover, the government needs to work on eliminating multiple levels of taxation, simplifying tax payment and ensuring certainty in tax laws to attract foreign investors to India.”</p>
<p>EY’s recommendations to encourage pooling of funds in India include suggestions that foreign investment in SEBI registered Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs) should be allowed under the automatic approval route regardless of the legal constitution of AIF – whether the AIF is constituted as a trust, LLP, company, or other corporate body. This would mean investing in, transferring, or redeeming investments in AIFs would not require the Government or Reserve Bank of India’s approvals. AIF foreign investment activities should also be subject to sectored foreign investment policy issued and updated by the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion, it said. The foreign investment restriction that currently applies to LLPs with foreign investment should be made inapplicable to a SEBI registered AIF constituted as an LLP.</p>
<p>In addition, EY said that SEBI-registered foreign venture capital investors should be permitted to invest in Category I AIFs without complying with the sector restrictions currently expressed in grant registration approval letters. AIFs with foreign investment that propose to make portfolio investments in Indian listed securities (secondary market acquisition) should also be forced to comply with the norms prescribed by SEBI under the SEBI (Foreign Institutional Investors) Regulations and the corresponding Reserve Bank of India regulations. It also recommended that the activities of an AIF manager should be specified in the list of non-fund-based activities that attract the minimum capitalization requirement of $500,000, regardless of the level of foreign ownership in the AIF management entity.</p>
<p>From a tax perspective, the tax pass-through status should also be granted to SEBI-registered AIFs, In line with the international practice where the pass-through status is automatically available to AIFs by choosing from various entities such as LLPs and LLCs. A pass-through system would ensure that tax collected on the fund’s income is no more than the tax that would have been payable if the investor directly invested in the company or asset, EY said. Income derived by foreign investors in SEBI-registered AIFs should be exempt from tax. Current tax provisions allow for tax exemption on long-term capital gains earned on the transfer of listed securities when transaction tax has been paid. The government should consider extending this to include long-term capital gains earned by AIFs on the transfer of unlisted companies, with suitable enhancements to the holding period.</p>
<p>Further, the double taxation avoidance agreements India has with countries such as Mauritius and Singapore have a favourable clause that provides tax exemption on capital gains. Where the capital gains earned by the foreign investors in AIF are tax-exempt, it would act as a strong deterrent for fund managers to raise India-dedicated funds from overseas jurisdictions. Simplification of the tax compliance mechanism for foreign investors is also a priority, EY added. “Reducing the tax compliance burden plays a significant role in attracting a large number of investors because of the simplicity of the investment process. In cases where taxes have been discharged or deducted by the trustees of AIF on the distribution of income, foreign investors should be exempt from Indian tax compliances in respect of the income received from the private equity fund.”</p>

<h1 id="chapter6">NYSTRS commits $150m to secondary investor Lexington Partners</h1>
<p class="text-info">New York State Teachers’ Retirement System(NYSTRS) has committed $150m to secondary private equity investor Lexington Partners to increase its exposure to emerging markets.</p>
<p>Lexington will make secondary investments in emerging markets including Asia and Latin America, focusing on interests that are less than 50 per cent funded according to Dow Jones, which cited a person familiar with the commitment. The pool is expected to target midmarket buyout and growth equity funds, the source said. Lexington closed its latest fund, Co-Investment Partners III, on $1.57bn last month. It said the fundraise represented the expansion of Lexington’s 15-year-old co-investment program, which has previously been supported by pension funds the Florida State Board of Administration and NYSTRS. Back in June it was reported that Lexington Partners was set to complete fundraising for another vehicle this year before launching its flagship fund in 2014. The firm held a first close for its third mid-market fund Middle Market Investors III in April and expects to hold a $750m final close by the end of the year.</p>

<h1 id="chapter7">Apollo buyout fund surges to $8.4bn weeks after $6.6bn first close</h1>
<p class="text-info">Apollo Global Management has pulled in a total of $8.4bn towards its latest flagship buyout fund just six weeks after holding a $6.6bn first close.</p>
<p>The recent surge in commitments has pushed Apollo Investment Fund VIII well past the halfway mark for its $14.9bn predecessor, which was raised in 16 months amid the first ragings of the global financial crash. Apollo is thought to be considering a similar upper-boundary for its latest fund following strong early performance from Fund VII, which closed in January 2009. That fund had a net IRR of 28 per cent at the end of June according to data released by Apollo in its second quarter results. Fund VI, which began investing in 2006 in the run up to the peak of the buyout boom, has fared less well, with a net IRR of 10 per cent, although the firm’s 2001 flagship was running at a 44 per cent net IRR at the end of June.</p>
<p>The firm’s economic net income from its private equity assets was $176.8m for the quarter – more than triple the amount for the same period 12 months ago. ENI is a non-standard measure many large buyout firms believe better reflects their profitability by taking into account ‘profit’ from both sold and unsold investments. The $124.6m quarter-over-quarter increase was largely driven by total carried interest income of $228.5m for the second quarter of 2013, compared to $5.7m for the second quarter of 2012, Apollo said. Apollo’s private equity funds increased their overall IRR by five per cent during the second quarter of 2013.</p>
<p>The firm revealed it has $13bn of uncalled private equity commitments as of June 30, and deployed $200m of buyout capital during the quarter. In March the firm agreed to buy the cake business of bankrupt group Hostess Brands, including the Twinkies brand, alongside C. Dean Metropoulos & Co after the company received no other bids. Hostess’ lawyers said in a filing with the US bankruptcy court in White Plains, NY, that “pursuant to the bidding procedures order, no auction will be conducted and buyer is the successful bidder.” Apollo and Metropoulos made a $410m offer for the cake business in January. </p>
<p>The firm’s overall ENI from all of its business segments, including buyout, credit and real estate, was $198m for the second quarter, well up on the $19m figure for the same period in 2012. Chairman and CEO Leon Black said, “Our results for the second quarter of 2013 reflect the continued strength of Apollo’s integrated global platform and value-oriented investment approach During the quarter we raised nearly $7bn of new capital across all of our business segments, and we generated more than $7n of realizations for our investors.”</p>

<h1 id="chapter8">Carlyle grows buyout dry powder to more than $20bn with US, Asia fundraises</h1>
<p class="text-info">Listed alternative assets giant Group pushed its private equity dry powder to more than $20bn in the second quarter of 2013 thanks to follow-up closings on its flagship US and Asia buyout funds.</p>
<p>The firm brought in an extra $3.8bn of private equity commitments from LPs in the quarter according to the latest results from the firm, boosting its overall fee-earning assets under management 18 per cent year-on-year to $132bn. Carlyle said asset inflows accounted for an extra $14.9bn over the preceding 12 months, offset by net distributions and outflows of $7.2bn. AltAssets reported in July that Carlyle was set to break the $10bn target for its sixth major US buyout fund after raking in $9.4bn of commitments from LPs. That fund has now closed on $10.3bn according to Carlyle co-CEO David Rubenstein, who added the fund could collect up to $12bn before its fundraising period expires in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>Rubenstein revealed the firm has held a first close on its third Japan fund and expected to hold a close “very shortly” on its fourth European buyout fund. He also said the firm held a final close on its third distress debt fund, Carlyle Strategic Partners III which is already in an accrued carry position. The two predecessor funds currently have a combined multiple on invested capital of 1.9x and gross IRR of 23 per cent, he added. Co-CEO William Conway revealed on a conference call two months earlier that the firm had raised $1.5bn for its fourth Asian buyout fund and expected to reach its $3.5bn target.</p>
<p>Carlyle generated net realized proceeds of $3.9bn from 144 different investments across 29 carry funds in the second quarter, and deployed $1.3bn of equity in 75 new or follow-on investments across 19 carry funds. The firm realized proceeds of $19.9bn and invested $8.8bn on a last twelve months basis. Rubenstein said, “We had a solid quarter across the firm and continued to demonstrate our ability to produce cash distributions for unitholders. Fundraising strengthened across the board, and we continue to invest in growth initiatives to build our capabilities.” Conway added, “Our global portfolio is in great shape and our pace of producing realized proceeds continues to be brisk. I am particularly pleased with the state of our US buyout portfolio which is producing large amounts of cash carry and accrued carry for future distributions.”</p>

<h1 id="chapter9">Crescent Capital destroys $2.5bn target for first fund since TCW spin-out</h1>
<p class="text-info">Credit investor Crescent Capital Group has obliterated the $2.5bn target for its first fund since spinning out of TCW Group two years ago by raking in $3.4bn of commitments.</p>
<p>Crescent Mezzanine Partners VI is easily the largest credit mezzanine fundraise the firm has ever been involved in, trumping the $2.8bn it last gathered while still a captive part of TCW in 2008. AltAssets revealed in April that the firm had already hit that figure for the new vehicle, continuing a pacey fundraise which saw it hold a $1bn first close in April 2012 after just a few months on the road. The latest vehicle is larger than the firm’s 2006 and 2001 vehicles combined, and tallies with rising opportunities in structured lending as banks pull away from loans following the global financial crash. Crescent co-founder and managing partner Jean-Marc Chapus said he believed the firm’s experience sourcing and investing $10bn of capital for more than 150 mezzanine transaction over the past two decades had persuaded investors to commit to the fund.</p>
<p>The firm typically targets investments in private equity-backed companies with enterprise values of more than $250m. Credit Suisse Securities, TCW Funds Distributors, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and France’s Finamvest all acted as placement agents for the vehicle. Earlier this year JPMorgan-owned alternative asset manager Highbridge Capital Management raised the biggest mezzanine debt vehicle since the financial crisis. The $5bn vehicle, the third-largest of its type ever raised, will use about half its capital financing private equity-backed buyouts according to the FT, with the rest used for straight corporate financing. That fund outstripped the $4bn mezzanine fund raised by buyout giant Blackstone through its GSO Capital Partners credit arm in early 2012.</p>

<h1 id="chapter10">Oaktree distributed $4.7bn to LPs in Q2 as fundraising continues apace</h1>
<p class="text-info">Distressed debt investment giant Capital distributed more than $4.7bn to investors from its closed-ended funds in the second quarter as it continues to market a swathe of new vehicles.</p>
<p>The firm revealed it had gathered $1.2bn of commitments from Oaktree Real Estate Opportunities Fund VI, pushing it close to its intended target of more than $1.5bn. That fund has been on the road since May 2011 following a stellar fundraise for its predecessor, which had invested 80 per cent of its capital at that time despite having three years left of its investment period. Oaktree’s second quarter results also revealed the firm had held a first close for its Emerging Markets Opportunities Fund in May and launched a separate account in July, bringing its committed capital for the strategy to $193m. That capital will be used to invest in distressed emerging market corporate debt.</p>
<p>AltAssets revealed in February that the firm was targeting $3bn for its latest mid-market vehicle, Principal Fund VI, but no further details about the fund are shown in the most recent results. Oaktree confirmed it was also marketing a European Dislocation Fund, which will target European private debt. The firm said its “incentive income” soared to $338.1m from $129m in the previous quarter thanks to a 63 per cent rise in revenues, which grew to $555.1m from $341.1m. About $272.5m of the incentive income came from OCM Opportunities Fund VIIb, a supplemental vehicle for its umbrella OCM Opportunities Fund VII which held about $14bn at its peak. The overall fund, which was launched in 2007, has a net IRR of 8.3 per cent and a 1.5-times multiple on drawn capital according to Oaktree, while the 2008-vintage ‘b’ vehicle was running at 18.2 per cent and two-times respectively.</p>
<p>Oaktree also revealed it had drawn down about 10 per cent of its $5bn Opportunities Fund IX, although added it was yet to begin investing through the fund. Oaktree chairman Howard Marks said, “Our investment teams continue to deliver both exceptional cash returns and new opportunities for future growth and income. In the second quarter, our closed-end funds distributed $4.7bn to investors, yielding record incentive income of $338.1m. As a demonstrated leader in credit strategies, we continue to raise significant capital for our newest products to provide our clients with superior risk-adjusted investment performance across market cycles.”</p>

<h1 id="chapter11">End in sight for Riverside buyout fundraise following hefty third close</h1>
<p class="text-info">Lower mid-market investor Company has held a third close for its latest buyout fund, AltAssets has learned.</p>
<p>Riverside Capital Appreciation Fund VI held a third close of $1.48bn in July with a final close expected in autumn, said a source with knowledge of the matter. Riverside refused to discuss the fundraise, citing SEC regulations. AltAssets reported in May that the firm had held a $1.29bn first close and expected to close the fund on its $1.5bn hard cap, well ahead of the initial $1bn target. The previous vehicle, CAF V, closed on $1.17bn in 2009, also exceeding its target of $900m. The fund has so far achieved strong returns with the first four exits generating an IRR of 33 per cent, according to the source. </p>
<p>The LPs that have backed the sixth fund include the Washington State Investment Board and the Los Angeles County Employees Retirement Association, which committed $150m and $100m respectively. The Ohio Police & Fire Pension Fund, the state of Rhode Island, the Oregon Public Employees Retirement Fund (OPERF) and the Maine Public Employees Retirement System also participated, investing a combined $244m. CAF VI is expected to make up to 30 investments in lower mid-market businesses with enterprise value of up to $150m. According to OPERF, the fund will be sector agnostic, but Riverside’s history “shows success” in the consumer, industrial and healthcare industries. In June, AltAssets said Riverside had raised $115m for its second Asia-Pacific fund, which is targeting $150m.</p>

<h1 id="chapter12">Värde Partners raises $900m for latest fund</h1>
<p class="text-info">Minneapolis-based distressed debt investor Värde Partners has reportedly raised nearly half of its $2bn fund.</p>
<p>Värde Fund XI has gathered $900m through a series of rolling closes after four months on the road according to Dow Jones, citing a person familiar with the situation. Last month AltAssets reported that the fund had secured a $200m commitment from Minnesota State Board of Investment (SBI). The firm’s previous vehicle was closed on just over $2bn in June 2011, beating its $1.7bn target. That total included a $22.5m commitment from SBI. In addition to its headquarters in Minneapolis, Värde has offices in London and Singapore. It invests in various assets including corporate securities, loans and real estate.</p>

<h1 id="chapter13">Mark Kvamme’s Drive Capital passes halfway point in debut fundraise</h1>
<p class="text-info">Drive Capital, a Cincinnati-based venture capital fund managed by Sequoia Capital partner and LinkedIn director Mark Kvamme, has raised more than half of its $300m target, AltAssets has learned.</p>
<p>Drive Capital Fund I has gathered $181m from 14 LPs, a document filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission showed. The fund, which has set a $1m minimum commitment requirement for investors, does not have a placement agent, according to the filing. The vehicle registered its first commitment last month. The fund will be focused on the Midwest and will make most of its investments in Ohio, Kvamme told the Columbus Business First. Kvamme did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>Kvamme launched Drive Capital with fellow Sequoia venture capitalist Christopher Olsen in November last year. During his time as a partner at Sequoia, which has invested in Google, Yahoo! and PayPal, Kvamme was focused on services and software companies. He is currently a director of LinkedIn, Cast Iron Systems, Funnyordie.com, StrongMail Systems, Mark Logic, and Adbrite, according to his LinkedIn page. In addition to his job at Sequoia, Kvamme has also served as a director of job creation at Ohio Governor’s Office and a director of the Ohio Department of Development. Last year Kvamme and Globespan Capital Partners led a $2m seed round for HR technology provider Gild.</p>

<h1 id="chapter14">Aperture Venture Partners raises sights for third healthcare vehicle</h1>
<p class="text-info">Early stage health and wellness investor Aperture Venture Partners has raised the bar slightly for its third vehicle by revealing a $100m target.</p>
<p>Aperture Venture Partners III is yet to receive any commitments towards that target according to a filing with the US securities regulator. That target is a third larger than the $75m Aperture attempting to raise for its second fund in 2010. No details were ever released about whether that fund hit its target. Aperture did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Healthcare entrepreneur Thomas Cooper is a new addition to the firm’s general partnership for this fundraise according to the filing, which lists him as a managing member. Fellow managing members Tony Natale, Paul Tierney and founder Eric Sillman are also listed, as they were for the firm’s second fundraise. </p>
<p>Cooper, who previously founded and managed Spectrum Emergency Care, Correctional Medical Services and x-ray and ECG provider Mobilex, is tasked with portfolio company operations. The firm targets companies in the medical device, biopharmaceutical, healthcare IT and services and diagnostic sectors. It currently has seven portfolio companies according to its website, including cornea specialist Avedro, wireless sending technology developer CardioMEMS and super-saturated oxygen treatment provider Therox. Prior to co-founding Aperture Sillman worked in M&A , equity and debt deals for UBS, helped companies assess expansion strategies at The Parthenon Group and assisted early stage companies with market analyses, financial management and organisation at TechnoServe.</p>
<p>Earlier this week AltAssets revealed that Oberland Capital, a healthcare financing specialist  set up by two former Paul Capital executives, was more than a third of the way to its $350m target for a private-equity investment vehicle. The Oberland Capital Healthcare fund has gathered just over $125m from four LPs according to a new filing registered with the US securities regulator. Fellow healthcare-focused firm Health Enterprise Partners raised more than two thirds of its second fund towards the end of June. Health Enterprise Partners II received commitments of $104.8m from 32 LPs according to another filing with the SEC, pushing it past the firm’s $91.3m debut vehicle.</p>

<h1 id="chapter15">SightLine Partner beats $100m target for second fund in final close</h1>
<p class="text-info">Venture capital firm SightLine Partners has beaten the $100m target for its second fund in holding a final close. SightLine Healthcare Opportunity Fund II (SLHOF II) was oversubscribed and has been closed on $107m, the firm said. The fund will make secondary direct investments in medical technology companies. SLHOF II was launched in April 2012 and raised $48.1m in its first ten months on the road, regulatory filings show. LPs committing to the fund include the Ohio Public Employees’ Retirement System, which approved a $25m investment last month.</p>
<p>SightLine managing director Buzz Benson said, “We are encouraged by the tremendous interest in the Fund, from an excellent group of investors. Our investment strategy of providing creative financial alternatives to existing investors in late-stage medical technology companies has been well-received in the market, as evidenced by the over-subscription in Fund II. There continues to be a critical financing gap for many high-quality companies in the med-tech sector and SightLine Partners is uniquely qualified to offer solutions to both the companies and investors facing this challenging environment.”</p>
<p>SightLine Partners is the successor to Piper Jaffray Ventures, having acquired its healthcare venture capital operations in 2004. The firm invests in late-stage medical technology companies. It said that a large number of medical device businesses have been founded over the past ten years and a lot of them face liquidity constraints due to “the lack of a vibrant IPO market and fewer M&A exits.” SightLine also noted that a growing number of venture funds are either capital constrained or are approaching the end of their investment period.</p>

<h1 id="chapter16">Great Oaks Venture Capital hits halfway point for $75m fund</h1>
<p class="text-info">New York-based firm Great Oaks Venture Capital has raised more than half of its $75m fund, AltAssets has learned.</p>
<p>The Great Oaks Venture Fund has secured commitments of $40.2m from 34 LPs, according to a document filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The fund does not have a placement agent and has a minimum investment requirement of $10,000. It registered its first commitment in August last year, the filing showed. Great Oaks did not immediately return a request for comment. According to a different document, the fund had raised almost $5m as of September 2012. Great Oaks invests between $50,000 and $500,000 in seed and early stage technology companies. It targets the e-commerce, advertising, software-as-a-service, cloud, mobile, social media, gaming and distribution sectors.</p>
<p>The firm is led by managing partners Andrew Boszhardt and Ben Lin, who both previously worked for Goldman Sachs. Boszhardt has also served as managing director and portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman. Other similar sized funds currently in the market include Bloomberg’s $75m vehicle, which will invest in and create early-stage technology companies.</p>

<h1 id="chapter17">Walden Venture Capital seeks $75m for latest fund</h1>
<p class="text-info">Venture capital firm Walden Venture Capital has launched its eighth fund with a $75m target, AltAssets has learned.</p>
<p>Walden Venture Capital (WVC) VIII does not have a minimum investment requirement and has yet to register its first commitment, a document filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission showed. However, a disclosure document release earlier this year by Kensington Capital Partners showed that the Canadian firm has committed $5m to the fund, which is double the amount it invested in Walden’s previous vehicle. The fund does not have a placement agent, the filing showed. It is an SBIC vehicle, which means it may be eligible to receive funding from the US Small Business Administration. Walden did not immediately return a request for comment.</p>
<p>The San Francisco-based firm says its Sprout Stage strategy “fills the chasm” between angel investors and larger venture capital firms. It makes initial investments of $500,000 to $2m in rounds of $1m to $4m and usually leads first institutional financings, but can join as a syndicate partner as well. “Unlike a large VC and more like an angel investor, smaller rounds are the core of our strategy and garner our full attention,” Walden said on its website. “Hence we are strongly aligned with the founders on building equity value, not focused on putting money to work. Unlike a typical angel, we are not sprinkling seeds in ideas to see what might grow, but instead focus our attention on fewer sprouts.”</p>

<h1 id="chapter18">GlaxoSmithKline launches $50m venture capital fund	</h1>
<p class="text-info">Pharmaceutical major GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) has launched a $50m venture capital fund to invest in bioelectronic medicines and technologies.</p>
<p>Action Potential Venture Capital (APVC) has already agreed to back Californian startup SetPoint Medical, which makes implantable devices to treat inflammatory diseases, in its first deal. APVC, which will be based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, will invest in five to seven businesses over the next five years. GSK said miniaturised devices, or bioelectronic medicines, could be designed to interface between the peripheral nervous system and specific organs to read, change or generate electronic impulses that help treat a wide range of disorders.  Chairman of GSK’s research and development unit Moncef Slaoui said, “We want to help create the medicines of the future and be the catalyst for this work. GSK can play the integrating role that is needed to drive this new type of medical treatment all the way from the bench to the patient and this fund is a key part of our efforts.” </p>
<p>Late last year Glaxo’s corporate venture arm led a $35m financing round for kidney injury treatment company Thrasos Therapeutics.</p>

<h1 id="chapter19">Linx Partners raises nearly $69m for third fund	</h1>
<p class="text-info">Lower mid-market private equity firm Partners has raised more than a quarter of its third fund, AltAssets has learned.</p>
<p>Linx Partners III has secured commitments of nearly $69m from 54 LPs, a document filed with US securities regulators showed. The Atlanta, US-based firm started marketing the fund in April this year. It said at that time that it was seeking $200m for the vehicle and expected to hold a first close in the second quarter of 2013. Linx gave $250m as the fundraising limit in the filing. The fund, which has no minimum investment requirement, registered its first commitment this month, according to the filing. Linx is focused on US-based companies in the industrial manufacturing, business services and specialty distribution sectors with annual revenues of $20m to $125m. Other similar sized funds currently in the market include New Harbor Capital’s recently launched $150m vehicle.</p>

<h1 id="chapter20">Riverstone looks to London to raise £500m-plus listed vehicle	</h1>
<p class="text-info">Energy-focused private equity major Riverstone Holdings is reportedly planning to float a new £500m-plus vehicle on the London Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan are already preparing the listing according to the FT, which cited people familiar with the matter. Riverstone closed its latest power and energy fund above its $7.5bn hard cap in June amid strong appetite from LPs for US energy vehicles. The Riverstone Global Energy & Power Fund V held a final close on $7.7bn. AltAssets revealed in December last year that Riverstone was preparing to break through its original $6bn target for the vehicle. Last month the firm partnered with crude oil midstream logistics company Bridger to invest up to $300m in the company’s growth strategy. Its operations span all major domestic crude oil production regions and basins, such as the Bakken, Rockies, Niobrara, Mid-Continent, Gulf Coast, Permian and Eagle Ford.</p>

<h1 id="chapter21">Glennmont Partners holds €200m first closing for clean energy infrastructure fund	</h1>
<p class="text-info">UK private equity infrastructure investor Glennmont Partners has held a €200m first closing for its second clean energy investment fund.</p>
<p>The fund has a final target of €450m, the firm said, though a recent SEC filing suggests it could be seeking as much as €50om. The fund received commitments from both new and existing investors, according to Glennmont managing partner Joost Bergsma. He said, “When we formed Glennmont our intention was to create a platform which fully aligned the interests of our investors with those of our team. We were clear that our specialist focus on clean energy infrastructure investments would appeal to institutional investors need for yield and long term capital appreciation. The strong response we have received to our second fund at this early stage reinforces those views.”</p>
<p>Glennmont, formerly BNP Paribas Clean Energy Partners,  was founded earlier this year after a spinning out from parent group BNP Paribas. At the time Bergsma said, “We had been thinking about this move for a little while. It will mean we will have a more agile decision-making environment. It will also create more alignment with our investors. Institutional investors increasingly want to be more aligned both on the up and down side.” The firm’s first fund raised €437m – making it the largest pure-play clean energy investment fund in Europe at the time of its final close in December 2010. Now fully committed, the firm has made investments worth over €1bn.</p>
<p>The firm focuses on raising long-term capital to invest into alternative power generation projects with proven technologies, such as wind, biomass, solar and small-scale hydro. “Clean energy infrastructure is a highly attractive asset class for those investors looking for lower-risk assets simultaneously offering wealth protection, consistent yield and capital value appreciation. Our specialised and focused team are seeing high calibre deal flow and this new fund will give us the capital required to realise value from the best of those deals,” said Bergsma.</p>

<h1 id="chapter22">Archer Capital reduces management fee on A$1.5bn buyout fund	</h1>
<p class="text-info">Australian private equity firm Archer Capital has reportedly temporarily reduced the management fee on its $1.5bn fifth fund, which is taking longer than expected to invest.</p>
<p>The firm has lowered the fee to 1.6 per cent from two per cent, said the Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter. Archer acquired the aged care unit of Lend Lease Group for A$270m in February this year in the only investment made from the fund so far. The LPs that have backed the vehicle include Canadian pension fund CPP. There have been few large buyouts in Australia in the past 18 months and other private equity firms that are active in the country, Carlyle and Bain, haven’t made any deals in the country since 2011, the report noted. Earlier this year Archer sold petrol station and oil import terminal business Ausfuel to Puma Energy.</p>

<h1 id="chapter23">Anacacia Capital exceeds Fund II target with A$150m final close	</h1>
<p class="text-info">Australian private equity firm Anacacia Capital, whose first fund was recognised as the best performing vehicle of its vintage, has closed its second vehicle above its target.</p>
<p>Anacacia Partnership II, which was initially targeting between A$50m and A$100m, has been closed on A$150m after receiving commitment offers three times the fund’s target size. The minimum target was exceeded in July 2012 when the fund held a first close of A$75m only a few months after launch. It had raised a further A$50m by November. Fund II is much larger than the firm’s A$55m maiden vehicle, which posted an annual gross IRR of 58 per cent and was ranked as the most outstanding fund raised between 2006 and 2008 by Pensions and Investments magazine. The new fund will follow the same strategy as the first fund, investing in businesses with revenues of up to A$100m and specialising in helping founders to transition with succession.</p>
<p>Anacacia has recently exited stakes in Rafferty’s Garden and Home Appliances for hefty returns, which were reported to be in the range between five and ten time. Anacacia managing director Jeremy Samuel noted that the firm successfully sourced new CEOs for both and added its directors to work alongside the founders. Another exit from the fund was the sale of lab chemicals and consumables company Lomb Scientific NYSE-listed ThermoFisher for a return of 4.3 times. Both these investments were made at the cusp of the global financial crisis, but both showed substantial growth, he added.</p>
<p>Samuel said, “We are grateful for the support of our investors and feel a deep obligation to do our best with the new fund to continue to seek outstanding people and businesses to support. We are very focussed on ensuring we make disciplined investment decisions consistent with our strategy to back strong management teams in first class small-medium enterprise. Rafferty’s Garden and Home Appliances were both classic Anacacia type investments and we are on the lookout for more similar businesses that we can assist to manage succession and growth.” Some of the firm’s other recent deals included the acquisition of the Hills Healthcare Equipment business from investment holding company Hills Holdings.</p>

<h1 id="chapter24">Aavishkaar misses second venture capital fund target with $94m final close	</h1>
<p class="text-info">Indian venture capital firm Aavishkaar has missed its initial $120m target by closing its second fund on INR5.73bn ($94m).</p>
<p>LPs that have backed the vehicle include CDC Group, Cisco, FMO, KfW, Rianta Capital and World Bank’s investment arm IFC. The vehicle follows the $14m India Micro Venture Capital Fund raised in 2007, which is now fully invested, IFC said. Aavishkaar India II will focus on healthcare, water and sanitation, education, agriculture and renewable energy sectors. It has already invested $17m across eight deals after holding its first close of $70m in September 2011, AVCJ said. Aavishkaar is currently raising a $60m fund to invest outside of India, expecting to hold a first close next month, said the publication. Last month investors within the Indian Angel Network launched a social impact fund to provide seed capital to provide financing to innovators working in renewable energy, education, water and healthcare.</p>
